<div class="commentbody">Hey there.  I’m a digital artist, I RmX pictures and also create AVS presets.  If you don’t know, AVS presets are cool little animations synchronized to music that you play in Winamp, an mp3 player.  They are created by mathematical coding and pre-defined effects that are layed out into lists and respond to music or sound.  It is really neat.  I mentioned that I also RmX (remix) pictures.  That means I make them in better quality, brighten them up, or the fun stuff - make them TOTALLY FREAKISHLY WEIRD.  I was just looking around for something like that to do, and I found this site.  I saw the “normal” and “not so normal” pictures and thought:  “This could be a chance to make another picture - “paranormal!”  So, will you let me remix your picture?  I promise it will be pretty weird, but pretty cool too. :)</div>
