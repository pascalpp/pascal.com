Today I chilled in the hood and watched some of Kill Bill volume 1 in preparation for going to see volume 2 later this week.

Tonight I went to Ripple, a bar in Brooklyn, 11% of which belongs to my friend Peter. It was really amazing to watch him hang out and tend bar into the wee hours. I felt like I was experiencing some alternate reality in which my friend Peter owned 11% of a bar.

Now we sleep.

PS. I had a cigarette last night. Man it was GOOD. My knees and my brain got all fuzzy. I think those things are addictive or something.

Don’t worry, I’m done with it. I have to run 20 fuckin miles on Saturday.
