George W. Bush is a baby-killer. And I’m not talking about the uncounted thousands of Iraqi babies. I’m talking about those most precious of creatures, AMERICAN babies.

According to the <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/editorial/outlook/2851283">Houston Chronicle</a>, abortion rates have gone up during Bush’s tenure as President:

<blockquote>Under Bush, the decade-long trend of declining abortion rates appears to have reversed. Given the trends of the 1990s, 52,000 more abortions occurred in the United States in 2002 than would have been expected before this change of direction.</blockquote>

Why would abortion go up under a self-proclaimed anti-abortion president? For one thing, two thirds of women having an abortion cite inability to afford a child as a primary reason. Under Bush, jobs have disappeared, incomes have declined, and poverty has shot up.

The Chronicle concludes:

<blockquote>Economic policy and abortion are not separate issues; they form one moral imperative. Rhetoric is hollow, mere tinkling brass, without health care, insurance, jobs, child care and a living wage. Pro-life in deed, not merely in word, means we need a president who will do something about jobs, health insurance and support for mothers.</blockquote>
