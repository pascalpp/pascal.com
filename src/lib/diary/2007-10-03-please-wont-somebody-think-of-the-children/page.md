I never thought I’d say that in all seriousness.

Today Congress sent Bush a bill to expand the SCHIP program to provide healthcare coverage for millions of low-income children who are currently uninsured. The SCHIP expansion is supported by 72% of Americans and large majorities in both houses of Congress. The cost of the expansion is $35 billion. Bush vetoed it.

Simultaneously, he’s asking Congress for an additional $200 billion to continue the operations in Afghanistan and the occupation of Iraq.

Representative David Obey aired the possibility of a war tax in order to fund the war effort without continuing to bury ourselves in debt. Most Americans would see a 2% increase in income taxes. Wealthier Americans would see a 10-15% increase. You know, to pay for the war. What a crazy idea.

Of course, this idea was a non-starter on both sides of the aisle: Democrats don’t want to give Republicans an opportunity to call them tax-and-spenders; Republicans don’t want anyone to have to sacrifice anything for their Very Important Global War on Terror™ other than the military service members and their families.

So no one wants a war tax. But Bush wants his money. So who’s going to pay for this war? Who’s going to have to own up when the bill comes due in 10 or 20 or 30 years?

Yep, those same kids whom Bush denied healthcare today.

Fuck those kids. Fuck all your kids.

Fuck you.
