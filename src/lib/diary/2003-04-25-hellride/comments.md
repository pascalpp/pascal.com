<div class="commentbody">Hi Pascal,  I really liked reading this entry. Parts of it really reminded me of something.  Two minor corrections:  1. My mom’s name is Kathleen. My Dad, Tom, and his current wife, Debbie, attended your show.  2. When we left the Crystal, it was my understanding that we were going to our house to ‘hang out’ and then crash.   I enjoyed the writing a lot in this entry. It felt ‘circular’ as if it was a story I had heard over and over from my grandpa.   See you soon!</div> -->
