<div class="commentbody">hello pascal… I am going to come to NYC and make you feel better. sorry that I haven’t written you back yet (may this suffice, however public it is. I’ll type something privately later). I’m hoping that your workout will prepare you for ‘lugging my gear’ (just kidding, because actually my gear is so very light). LOVE AND RICE CAKES, rosie</div> -->
