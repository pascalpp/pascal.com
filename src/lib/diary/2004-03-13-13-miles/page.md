Waking up the day after the party, I felt a little woogy but not too bad. Eventually I felt normal enough to go do my day’s run. So I did the Brooklyn-Manhattan bridge loop three times again, like last week, and then I ran to the gym and did another mile on the treadmill. Once you’ve run 12 or 13 miles it hurts less to just keep running than it does to stop. Then I stretched for like a half-hour and sat in the steam room for a good while too.

Runner’s diaries are so fucking lame.
