<div class="commentbody">Electoral votes create UNEQUAL treatment for voters. Compare the most thinly populated states (e.g., Wyoming) that receive a minimum of 3 Electoral votes (one vote per 2 Senators plus 1 House Representative).  Populous states get House representatives based on actual Census. A voter in Wyoming has Electoral weight equal to 3 voters in California or New York state.  Raw deal for the big city “blues.”</div>

<div class="commentbody">The comment by anonymous coward does infer an interesting question: what would be a “fair” way to manage an election?

Majority rules is “fair” to a large degree. However, you can get “Tyranny of the Majority”, where the Majority can strip rights from the Minority. However, if you give the Minority too much veto power, the Majority’s legitimate desires can be thwarted. That’s one good reason for the Bill of Rights: it has basic guarantees for Minorities despite a Majority deciding against a certain Right.

The original intent of the Founders of the US (and this is not to say that “Original Intent” should always be Sacrosanct), was to protect less populous states from the more populous states. A good exampe issue is that of water rights. Rural areas need more water for their agricultural livelihood. Urban areas need more water for their larger population’s basic needs. What’s fair? Who should win?

I’m very unhappy about the Electoral College, but it’s not clear to me how to replace it. It’s even harder to imagine an alternative that could even pass as an Amendment.

I think we stuck with an electoral process that’s so Weird that no other Democracy has anything like it.</div>

<div class="commentbody">Well, you need to truely take a look at a County by County map,,,,showing how the only reason democrats heave even the slightest chance to win is because major huge metropolitan areas with large majority minority votes, control the state outcomes because they vote 90% Democrat….It is the only reason Democrats have any chance in elections…County wide results show this process,,how 2 or 3 blue counties control the entire election results from Michigan</div> -->
