<div class="commentbody">Hey Pascal!

I just bought your album, after happily listening to the clips at work. (I am still in the library at U.S.M.) I want you to know that I still sing about “chopping broccoli” to myself everytime I am doing just that. Not to mention la-zag-na. Cannot wait to get it. One day, maybe you can play in Hattiesburg…</div>

<div class="commentbody">That is nothing.  Nothing I tell you.  Once, when I was in college, I subsisted on a diet of Jack in the Box for a period of no less than 2 months straight.  Very little else was consumed.  During class once I almost screamed out for dear life.  I had sudden mind numbing pains in my abdomen.  I almost freaked out but held it together for the rest of class.  I felt sure I would lay down an immense trail of sludge as I worked my way to the bathroom.  To my surprise I passed no solid waste.  But rather proceeded to pipe out a fart for approximately 30 seconds.  At this point I pinched off the sphincter muscle and proceeded to scream with laughter.  I was maniacal.  I mean 30 second…Come on?  Once I had composed myself I released and proceeded to outgas another 30 seconds of methane.  I was done.  I was spent.  I needed to lie down.  But I’ll be damned if I didn’t have a smile on my face for the rest of the day.  To this day however I have never partaken in that earthly pleasure known as the Jack in the Box.</div> -->
