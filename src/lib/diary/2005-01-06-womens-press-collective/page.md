Tonight I volunteered for a couple hours at the Women’s Press Collective. We inventoried all the ink and paper stock and made jokes about miniature envelopes for business cards. Yep, they got some.

The WPC is a grassroots volunteer-driven organization which aims to make publishing facilities more readily available to other organizations and individuals who are trying to make the world a little better. They recognize that all progressive movements of the past were forced to develop their own means of getting their message out, and that this is even truer today as our national media gets more and more consolidated and corporate-controlled.

Anyway, it was a good time. They have this awesome old press, a Chief 15. It looks like a one-person tank. Looking forward to learning how to run that thing. I’m heading back on Saturday to help with a magazine distribution and then next Wednesday for who knows what.
