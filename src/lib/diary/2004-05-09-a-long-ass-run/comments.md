<div class="commentbody">Howdy Pascal.  Just peeking in from VA, it’s nice to see you’re still kicking around up there and writing more often.  You may remember me as one of the guys that crashed on your floor last summer while we [All of Fifteen] were on tour.  I have funny photos of you leaping in the air next to a candelabra, I’ll have to email them.</div> -->
