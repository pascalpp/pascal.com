Okay so I been fallin down on the job here…

Let’s see where am I?

Well, some time in late March I took my leave of Willow for the time being and headed home to Alabama to visit my family. Nick and Valerie are making arrangements to have the boat delivered to the Virgin Islands, where they will fly to meet it. From there I believe they’ll head south to Trinidad and Tobago or thereabouts, to get out of the hurricane belt by June or so.

Unfortunately I don’t think I’ll be joining them, at least not anytime soon.

Instead, I’ve decided to move to Birmingham and work on music full time. I’ll be posting some recent photos sometime soon.
