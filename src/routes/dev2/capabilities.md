# About me

I’m a full-stack web developer and technical lead with a focus on user interface design and development. I love to drive projects from concept to completion, and I’m passionate about building beautiful, intuitive, and functional user experiences.

I have a strong eye for the details that make a great product: performance, ease of use, accessibility, color, layout, well-written copy, and typography. I always strive to understand the needs of the end user and let empathy guide my design and development. I’m a strong believer in the power of user research, learning by doing, and continuous iteration to improve a product.

I enjoy taking on larger problems and breaking them down into smaller ones, separating and simplifying responsibilities, and translating those ideas into a modular component architecture to build scalable and maintainable applications.
