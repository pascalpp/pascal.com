# About me

I’m a full-stack web developer with a focus on user interface design and development. I love to drive projects from concept to completion, and I’m passionate about building beautiful, intuitive, and functional user experiences.

I have a strong eye for detail and I tend to obsess over every aspect of a project: typography, color, layout, copy, ease of use, and accessibility. I always strive to understand the needs of the end user and let empathy guide my design decisions. I’m a strong believer in the power of user research, learning by doing, and continuous iteration to improve my work.

I enjoy taking on larger problems and breaking them down into smaller ones, separating and simplifying responsibilities, and translating those ideas into a modular component architecture to build scalable and maintainable applications.
