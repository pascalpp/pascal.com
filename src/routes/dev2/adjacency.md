Worked as a lead frontend developer on websites for several high-profile clients, including Apple, Adobe, Land Rover, Motorola, Rollerblade, Specialized Bikes, Patagonia, and others. At Apple, I worked on-site on the original Apple Store. Along with two of my Adjacency colleagues, I co-authored <u>**Creating Killer Interactive Websites**</u>, published by Hayden Books in 1997. Adjacency was acquired by Sapient in 1999.
