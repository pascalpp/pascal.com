In the interest of getting those ugly blisters off the front page of my diary, I thought I would post some pictures of my belly. I been losing weight, so I thought I’d document it here. I don’t care if you don’t care.

Funny thing is, as I was zooming in on this picture, I noticed that it started to resemble my uncle Philip. Click on the image and you’ll see what I mean.
