The Bush campaign has repeatedly chided the Kerry campaign for trying to scare people into voting for him. This might not be the height of hypocrisy, but it’s definitely up there. Bush’s latest TV ads are called “WOLVES”, “RISK”, and “DON’T TAKE CHANCES”. The Homeland Security Department’s Terror Alert Level has repeatedly been raised at politically opportune times for the Bush White House. In the run-up to the war in Iraq, Bush and his chief officers exaggerated the threat posed by Saddam, stating as fact that he planned to develop and use biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons. “We can’t wait for the smoking gun, which may come in the form of a mushroom cloud.” The Bush Campaign has repeatedly implied that if Kerry is elected, we are more likely to suffer a terrorist attack, and that terrorists may try to strike our cities with nuclear weapons.

Bush claims to be fighting a War on Terror. But in fact, Terror is Bush’s primary weapon. He’s used it well. On us.
