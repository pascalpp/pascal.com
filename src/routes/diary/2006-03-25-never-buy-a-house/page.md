Okay, of course you should buy a house, if you can. But man is fixing up and selling a house a pain in the ass. Especially when you don’t know shit about fixin or sellin. I hate pains in the asses.

<div class="commentbody">what if it truly doesn’t matter if you sell or fix the house?What if the task is simply to unfold in your essential nature…capable of living fully and passionately present.  I’m in Montreal city, Qu�bec… I’m 51y.o in an old house too and I try to do just that. Wish me luck!</div>
