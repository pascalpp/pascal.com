George W. Bush doesn’t represent you or me. He’s a rich man who works for other rich men. When Enron cooked their books and sapped the retirement funds of thousands of investors, a few Enron underlings took the fall, but none of the higher-ups – all friends of G.W. – underwent any kind of criminal prosecution.

I could list a lot more examples, but I’m tired and don’t feel like doing the research right now. Go dig a little. Just a wee bit.
