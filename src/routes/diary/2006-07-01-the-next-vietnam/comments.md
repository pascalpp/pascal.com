<div class="commentbody">To Phil,

Its your “boys” who’re getting their “asses” kicked numbnut, along with the ordinary iraqui citizens. Like all wars the nutcase scumbags, from the leaders (Bush/Saddam) to the ignorant racist rednecks (Abu Ghraib US soldiers / Al-Quaeda) peddle their psychopathic tendencies </div>

<div class="commentbody">3,300 people dead who will never have the chance to have  children, or grandchildren…in 100 years 30,000 lives that will never be.  What dreams lost?  What poems not written? What discoveries not made?  All for a war built on a lie, fought against a people who did not attack us, so that the vanity of one president could be served in vengence against another man who sought to kill his father.

(Saddam Hussein attempted to assasinate Papa Bush.)

And as for the money spent? It could have paid for 1,000,000 young men & women to go to college for four years. How bright a future would we all have if that had come to pass?</div> -->
