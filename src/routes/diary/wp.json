    "post_content": "So for some reason I'm a pretty regular reader of CNN.com. It's one of the few sites I actually visit in a browser directly -- everything else I read is via RSS in NetNewsWire. (If you haven't tried RSS, you should.)\r\n\r\nAs a liberal and regular DailyKos reader, I find that CNN.com gives me a pretty good overview of the issues (or non-issues) that are occupying (or being fed into) the American consciousness at a given moment in time. A lot of it is crap, but that's to be expected. Nonetheless, there is one part of CNN.com that regularly infuriates me: the Quick Vote.\r\n\r\nThis feature asks a simple question of CNN.com readers, usually with Yes or No responses. What infuriates me most is that it has the potential to be a tremendous feature, but that potential is almost always completely wasted each time a new question is posted. Because the questions they ask are so fucking inane! And worse, they only allow readers to answer Yes or No. There is no room for nuance.\r\n\r\nSo I've decided to mirror CNN.com's Quick Vote feature here on my blog, with an important third option: \"I don't care\". Let's begin. Answer honestly!\r\n\r\n[poll=2]",

    "post_content": "I would certainly agree that there is no good reason the primary process should be this long.  But the problem lies in how early the primary process starts, not how long it is taking to resolve itself. We've been watching the potential Democratic candidates jockeying for position for over a year now, and that's obviously too long. But I think that is largely an indicator of how eager everyone is, including the traditional corporate media, to see this lame fucking President replaced. And that eagerness is a good thing.\r\n\r\nBut now it's down to two candidates, Obama and Clinton. (I'm an avowed Obama supporter, but I would vote for Clinton in a heartbeat if she were to win the nomination.) As things are, many are calling for Clinton to throw in the towel. Some are saying that this prolonged primary is bad for the Democratic party, that the in-fighting and division will hurt us in the long run. There are plenty of reasons why Clinton might withdraw, but there are some very good things about this prolonged Democratic primary.\r\n\r\nFor one, our candidates are getting a good workout. Whoever emerges will be stronger and better able to handle the crap the GOP will throw at them this fall.\r\n\r\nFor another, our candidates are getting more air time, which is important in winning voters for the general election.\r\n\r\nAnd third, perhaps most importantly, citizens from all the states are seeing that their vote matters for the first time in a long time. Usually the nomination is settled and done with by the time the New Hampshire primary rolls around, or soon after. This time, every state is having a chance to weigh in. As a result, new voters are registering as Democrats in record numbers across the nation. This is terrific for building the power of the party in the run-up to the general election, and for maintaining a healthy party once Obama wins in November.\r\n\r\nYes, that's right, he will!\r\n\r\n",

    "post_content": "It's kind of obvious, isn't it?\r\n\r\nAirlines have pretty high fixed costs. They have to rely on a high volume of business to cover those fixed costs and turn a profit. If ridership goes down, they can reduce the frequency of flights and save some money, but the overall infrastructure which they have to maintain can't be shrunk or grown very rapidly in conjunction with the ebb and flow of consumer demand.\r\n\r\nThe airline industry has two primary customers: the business traveler and the leisure traveler. The majority of leisure travelers are middle-class folks who are going on vacation or going to visit family. As middle-class folk earn less money, they have to work more and their ability to get time away from work goes down. And if they can get time away, they are less able to afford an expensive vacation that involves air travel.\r\n\r\nThe impact of a shrinking middle-class on business travel is more indirect, but significant nonetheless. As middle-income folks lose their purchasing power, demand for the products and services most businesses provide decreases. As a result, the businesses spend less on business travel and other expenditures. An oversimplified example, I know, but you get the idea.\r\n\r\nIf the middle class continues to shrink, more airlines will have to close up shop. Eventually the only people flying may be the uber-rich in their private jets.",

    "post_content": "Tommy McCall at The New York Times has posted&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/10/14/opinion/20081014_OPCHART.html\">this set of charts</a>&nbsp;show the return one would see from a $10,000 investment in the S&amp;P index under each political party over the last 80 years. Under 40 years worth of Democratic administration, your return would be $300,671. Under roughly the same during of Republican administration, your return would be only $51,211. (And if you include Herbert Hoover's term, the Republican return drops to just $11,733.) All very interesting.\r\n\r\nBut this leads me to wonder about something. The investor class has historically favored Republican candidates for President, at least in terms of campaign contributions. (I should find a source for this, but for the sake of argument, lets assume that statement is true.) Do you think, given the above information, investors are likely to change their ways and throw more of their campaign dollars behind Democratic candidates in the future? I tend to think not.\r\n\r\nI wonder if this might stem from the pervasive sense of exceptionalism that Americans hold about themselves. American exceptionalism is often a force for good; we tend to believe we can achieve our goals even when the odds are against us, and sometimes our determination helps us beat those odds. But I think exceptionalism causes us to act foolishly as well. On the macro level, for example, there is our heavy-handed foreigh policy. But sticking to the micro level, the level of the invidual, I think a sense of exceptionalism leads many to participate in the lottery even though they know it is a losing proposition. They somehow hope that they can be the one, the lucky one. Lotteries would have zero participation were it not for exceptionalism.\r\n\r\nPerhaps investors are a victim of this exceptionalist thinking as well. I don't have a source for this either, but it seems to be accepted fact that the very wealthy do better under Republican administrations than under Democratic ones, when it comes to tax policy and billion-dollar military contracts and such. But the charts above refute the idea that all investors do better under Republican rule. Perhaps the bulk of investors give their campaign dollars to Republicans in hopes that they, too, can win the lottery.\r\n\r\n(Via&nbsp;<a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/10/16/bulls-bears\">Daring Fireball</a>)",

    "post_content": "Like a <a href=\"http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/why_apple_spaces_is_broken\">lot</a> of <a href=\"http://www.dribin.org/dave/blog/archives/2007/11/13/spaces/\">folks</a>, I'm not quite happy with the implementation of Spaces in Leopard. Overall, I think it's a beautiful solution, but as <a href=\"http://www.dribin.org/dave/blog/archives/2007/11/13/spaces/\">Dave Dribin</a> points out, Apple is trying to make an advanced feature accessible to the masses, and as a result, it doesn't work very well for the folks who will likely use it most: power users.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, making power user features accessible to regular users has been one of Apple's fort&eacute;s, and they've usually managed to do so while still maintaining the flexibility that power users require. With Spaces, however they've fallen short of that mark. It's a new feature, so hopefully they'll improve it with future updates. Here's one way I think they could improve it dramatically.\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/spaces-proposal.jpg' alt='spaces-proposal.jpg' />\r\n\r\nThe above screenshot shows the Spaces prefpane with one simple addition: a checkbox, selected by default, which reads \"Switch Spaces automatically.\" With this checkbox on, Spaces would behave as it currently does, automatically switching Spaces when you switch to an app whose frontmost window is hidden in another space. (Perhaps they could smarten it up a bit so it wouldn't automatically switch if the given app already has a window open in the current space, but I digress.)\r\n\r\nWith this checkbox off, Spaces would never switch spaces for you. Instead you would stay in the current space until <strong>you decide to switch spaces yourself</strong>, either by invoking the meta-view and clicking another space, or by using the modifier keys defined in the Spaces prefpane.\r\n\r\nSo suppose you're in space 3 and all your currently-open Safari windows are in space 1. If you switch to Safari, it would act as if there were no windows open and open a new one for you. So each space is truely like a new monitor, a new workspace, oblivious of its partners.\r\n\r\nLet's follow this through a bit more. There are certain window types that you'd want to have available in every space. For example, Safari's Preferences window, or its Downloads window, or Mail's Activity window. These would be useful to have in every space. But what if Safari's Downloads window is already open in space 1, and you press Command-Option-L while in space 3? With auto-switching off, invoking any window that is already open in another space would <strong>bring it to you</strong> in the current space, rather than swooping you over to it. So if you're in space 3 and you want to look at that Ebay auction item that's open in some other space, you could choose the window from Safari's Windows menu, or from Safari's Dock menu, and it would swoop into view in your current space, keeping you in place, not disrupting your workflow or your context.\r\n\r\nI think this simple change would go a long way toward making Spaces work for the power users who are most likely to get the most use out of it, while still keeping it simple and accessible for folks like my dear old Mom.\r\n\r\n[Hat tip to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/philoye\">@philoye</a> for thinking this through with me.]\r\n\r\n[<a href=\"http://digg.com/apple/A_proposal_for_improving_Spaces_in_Leopard\">Digg this story</a>]",

    "post_content": "<img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/misc/iphone-switcher/preview.png\" class=\"noborder\" />\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that from a UI perspective, the problem of multitasking in iPhone OS has already been solved. Both Safari and the Springboard (Home) app have the ability to slide from window to window, or screen to screen. A similar solution could be used to switch between running applications. Let's call it 'App Switching Mode.'\r\n\r\nThe only major UI detail to sort out is how to enter App Switching Mode. Presumably it would be triggered by some touch gesture. For example, perhaps you could hold the home button while swiping left or right on the screen. What the exact gesture might be is anyone's guess; for the purposes of this proposal let's just call it the 'App Switching Gesture.'\r\n\r\nPerforming the App Switching Gesture would shrink the current app screen down, revealing the screens of other running apps on the left and right. Then you'd use the familiar left and right swipes to move from app to app, and then tap an app to bring it forward. Like I said, very similar to pages in Safari.\r\n\r\n<h3>The Demo</h3>\r\n\r\nHere's a quick demo I put together with the helpful magic of <a href=\"http://www.jquery.com\">jQuery</a>. Since it's a pain to imitate multitouch gestures in Javascript, I just created buttons as stand-ins. Click 'App Switching Gesture' to see the demo, then click 'Swipe Left' or 'Swipe Right' to move from screen to screen. Then tap an app to bring it forward. (I only tested this demo in Safari and Firefox, so I make no guarantees that it will work in other browsers.)\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.pascal.com/misc/iphone-switcher/\" width=\"800\" height=\"680\" border=\"0\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nClicking the 'x' on an app would close that app, just as pressing the home button does currently. Switching to the Home app would allow you to launch any other app, which would then show up as another screen in the app switcher. If you launch an app that's already running, it would just switch to that app rather than spawn a new process, similar to Spaces on Mac OS X. In fact this whole concept is similar to Spaces, except that there is only one app per space, and only one space per app.\r\n\r\nOne nice thing about this solution is that it wouldn't require users to change their existing behavior whatsoever. They can click the home button and use the Springboard app as a rudimentary app switcher, just as we all currently do.\r\n\r\nOne thing this demo does not address is how to limit the number of running applications. I assume that Apple will eventually improve CPU speed and battery life enough to enable multitasking, but I also assume they'll place a limit on the number of running apps, similar to the limit of 8 pages open in Safari. Say they set the limit at 8 running applications. What happens when you try to launch a ninth? That's a bit of a stumper. Hopefully they're working on it.\r\n\r\nOne thing that might help solve that problem is a more robust notifications framework. Hopefully they're working on that too.\r\n\r\n",

    "post_content": "<em><small>[ I'd like to preface this by saying that multitasking is not the same as allowing apps to run in the background. This is really a UI for better app-switching (cf. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/camh/statuses/8874382135\">this tweet from @camh</a>) — whether the non-frontmost apps are still actually running is a separate discussion. They could just as easily be 'sleeping,' as apps do today when you press the home button. ]</small></em>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/misc/iphone-switcher/preview.png\" class=\"noborder\" />\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that from a UI perspective, the problem of multitasking in iPhone OS has already been solved. Both Safari and the Springboard (Home) app have the ability to slide from window to window, or screen to screen. A similar solution could be used to switch between running applications. Let's call it 'App Switching Mode.'\r\n\r\nThe only major UI detail to sort out is how to enter App Switching Mode. Presumably it would be triggered by some touch gesture. For example, perhaps you could hold the home button while swiping left or right on the screen. What the exact gesture might be is anyone's guess; for the purposes of this proposal let's just call it the 'App Switching Gesture.'\r\n\r\nPerforming the App Switching Gesture would shrink the current app screen down, revealing the screens of other running apps on the left and right. Then you'd use the familiar left and right swipes to move from app to app, and then tap an app to bring it forward. Like I said, very similar to pages in Safari.\r\n\r\n<h3>See it in action</h3>\r\n\r\nHere's a quick demo I put together with the helpful magic of <a href=\"http://www.jquery.com\">jQuery</a>. Since it's a pain to imitate multitouch gestures in Javascript, I just created buttons as stand-ins. Click 'App Switching Gesture' to see the demo, then click 'Swipe Left' or 'Swipe Right' to move from screen to screen. Then tap an app to bring it forward. (I only tested this demo in Safari and Firefox, so I make no guarantees that it will work in other browsers.)\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://www.pascal.com/misc/iphone-switcher/\" width=\"800\" height=\"680\" border=\"0\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nClicking the 'x' on an app would close that app, just as pressing the home button does currently. Switching to the Home app would allow you to launch any other app, which would then show up as another screen in the app switcher. If you launch an app that's already running, it would just switch to that app rather than spawn a new process, similar to Spaces on Mac OS X. In fact this whole concept is similar to Spaces, except that there is only one app per space, and only one space per app.\r\n\r\nOne nice thing about this solution is that it wouldn't require users to change their existing behavior whatsoever. They can click the home button and use the Springboard app as a rudimentary app switcher, just as we all currently do.\r\n\r\nOne thing this demo does not address is how to limit the number of running applications. (If Apple ever implements multitasking on the iPhone, I assume they'll still place a limit on the number of running apps, similar to the limit of 8 pages open in Safari.) Say they set the limit at 8 running applications. What happens when you try to launch a ninth? That's a bit of a stumper. Hopefully they're working on it.\r\n\r\nOne thing that might help solve that problem is a more robust notifications framework. Hopefully they're working on that too.\r\n\r\nObviously there are some technical hurdles, specifically CPU usage and battery life, that make multitasking on the current iPhone impractical. Presumably those issues will be mitigated with time. But it may also be the case that Apple doesn't feel that the convenience that multitasking provides would outweigh the UI complexities that accompany it. The iPad, which has a killer CPU and great battery life, doesn't have multitasking either — which may be an indicator that Apple doesn't plan to implement multitasking even when CPU usage and battery life aren't an issue. I hope I'm wrong on that count.\r\n",

    "post_content": "<em>[ I'd like to preface this by saying that multitasking is not the same as allowing apps to run in the background. This is really a UI for better app-switching (cf. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/camh/statuses/8874382135\">this tweet from @camh</a>) — whether the non-frontmost apps are still actually running is a separate discussion. They could just as easily be sleeping,\n\n<img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/misc/iphone-switcher/preview.png\" class=\"noborder\" />\n\nIt seems to me that from a UI perspective, the problem of multitasking in iPhone OS has already been solved. Both Safari and the Springboard (Home) app have the ability to slide from window to window, or screen to screen. A similar solution could be used to switch between running applications.

For example, perhaps you could hold the home button while swiping left or right on the screen. What the exact gesture might be is anyone's guess; for the purposes of this proposal let's just call it the 'App Switching Gesture.'\n\nPerforming the App Switching Gesture would shrink the current app screen down, revealing the screens of other running apps on the left and right. Then you'd use the familiar left and right swipes to move from app to app, and then tap an app to bring it forward. Like I said, very similar to pages in Safari.\n\n<h3>See it in action</h3>\n\nHere's a quick demo I put together with the helpful magic of <a href=\"http://www.jquery.com\">jQuery</a>.

They can click the home button and use the Springboard app as a rudimentary app switcher, just as we all currently do.\n\nOne thing this demo does not address is how to limit the number of running applications. (If Apple ever implements multitasking on the iPhone, I assume they'll still place a limit on the number of running apps, similar to the limit of 8 pages open in Safari.) Say they set the limit at 8 running applications. What happens when you try to launch a ninth? That's a bit of a stumper. Hopefully they're working on it.\n\nOne thing that might help solve that problem is a more robust notifications framework. Hopefully they're working on that too.\n\nObviously there are some technical hurdles, specifically CPU usage and battery life, that make multitasking on the current iPhone impractical. Presumably those issues will be mitigated with time. But it may also be the case that Apple doesn't feel that the convenience that multitasking provides would outweigh the UI complexities that accompany it. The iPad, which has a killer CPU and great battery life, doesn't have multitasking either — which may be an indicator that Apple doesn't plan to implement multitasking even when CPU usage and battery life aren't an issue. I hope I'm wrong on that count.\n",

    "post_content": "A lot of people, particularly those concerned with sales figures and market share, are discussing whether the iPad is a PC. In my view, it obviously is, in which case Apple is now the leading PC vendor after decades of below-5% market share. Bully for them.\n\nBut what's more interesting to me is the question of whether regular people will ever use the term 'PC' to refer to an iPad. To me, it seems more likely that the term 'PC' will fall out of fashion, and that soon people will simply refer to their primary computers as 'tablets', or possibly just 'iPads'. Even if their tablet isn't actually an iPad.\n\nApple has created the new Kleenex.",

    "post_content": "During <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2011/06/netnewswire_black_pixel\">this excellent interview</a> about the sale of NetNewsWire to Black Pixel, Brent Simmons shares this interesting insight:\n\n<blockquote>I’ve always thought of it this way: a good writer reads a lot of books. They see how other writers solve problems. They pay attention to what’s happening now as much as they pay attention to the classics. Good writers are readers first, but eagle-eyed, careful readers.\n\nI think good developers are the same: they look at other apps. They “read” those apps, the problems they have and how they solve them. They notice trends, they notice new solutions, they notice when things work and when they don’t.\n\nNot every developer does that. Some do, but pretty much limit themselves to Apple apps, which means they’re missing some interesting things. And some developers try but haven’t yet developed the close eye it takes. (It just takes practice.)\n\nThere may still be some developers who say there’s no place for style and fashion in UI, that usability is usability and that’s that. They’re mistaken, because part of human nature is to get tired of things and want fresh things, and UI is where the computer meets human nature. Human nature is not going to change on this matter. And I’m glad about that.</blockquote>",

    "post_content": "I've finally retired my aging Mac Pro tower. I bought the 8-core model in April 2007, and managed to keep it feeling quite snappy with a few upgrades along the way: 17gb of RAM, a 500mb SSD drive, and a new video card. I also retired my 30-inch cinema display from 2004.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm considering making the leap to <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/\">the new Mac Pro tower</a> that should be released any day now, I'm currently using my 2011 MacBook Pro full-time, along with a 27-inch Thunderbolt display, and it's doing the job pretty well. (I installed the SSD from the old Mac Pro, and maxed the RAM at 16gb.) So I might stick with this and not bother getting the new Mac Pro.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I really miss is the three extra drive bays in the old Mac Pro. In the second bay I had a pretty fast data drive for my everyday projects and my large iTunes and iPhoto libraries. In the third bay, a really fast drive dedicated to Final Cut Pro projects. And in the fourth bay, a 3TB drive for Time Machine Backups. (I also use SuperDuper to backup my startup drive nightly; and after every Final Cut session, I'd backup my video drive to an external drive via a <a href=\"http://www.newertech.com/products/voyagerq.php\">NewerTech drive dock</a>.\r\n\r\nSo now that I have a Thunderbolt-capable machine, I've been exploring the available options for getting all those drives online with my new rig. I'm looking for a simple drive expansion chassis, something that will allow me to use all these drives without having a stack of external enclosures and power cables cluttering my desk. Here's what I've found.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.areca.us/products/thunderbolt.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ARC-8050.jpg\" alt=\"ARC-8050\" width=\"170\" height=\"307\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-287\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Areca ARC-8050</strong> – around $1450 empty\r\nAt the top of the list, the <a href=\"http://www.areca.us/products/thunderbolt.htm\">ARC-8050 by Areca</a>. This is an 8-bay minitower that supports every RAID level you can imagine, or you can use it as just a bunch of disks (JBOD). You can even mix and match, using some of the bays for a RAID config and others as independent disks. Final Cut guru Larry Jordan has written <a href=\"http://www.larryjordan.biz/product-review-areca-8050-thunderbolt-raid/\">a great review of the ARC-8050</a>. Areca also makes <a href=\"http://www.areca.us/products/thunderbolt5026.htm\">a similar device with just 4 bays</a> for around $850.\r\n\r\nWhile a fast RAID is great for video projects, that's not the problem I'm trying to solve right now. The ARC-8050 is a bit pricey, and sounds like it's a bit tricky to configure. I'm also not impressed with the very un-Mac-like software it ships with. And since I'm considering moving to a new Mac Pro in the near future, I'm going to keep my eyes on this company and see if they release a Thunderbolt 2 version with better software.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.drobo.com/products/professionals/drobo-5d/\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/drobo.jpg\" alt=\"drobo\" width=\"200\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-293\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Drobo 5D</strong> - around $700 empty\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.drobo.com/products/professionals/drobo-5d/\">Drobo 5D</a> allows you to insert up to 5 drives and it stripes your data across all the drives for speed and redundancy. This is similar to RAID 5, but the Drobo requires basically no configuration, and lets you use drives of any size. The 5D is the first Drobo to support Thunderbolt. It also has a slot for an SSD card that accelerates transfer speeds. Here again, <a href=\"http://www.larryjordan.biz/product-review-drobo-5d/\">Larry Jordan has an excellent review</a>.\r\n\r\nI already own the original 4-bay Firewire Drobo, but it is painfully slow and unusable for day-to-day work, so I've retired it to service as a media storage device attached directly to my Airport wifi base station. It sounds like the 5D is considerably faster, even fast enough for multicam video editing. But again, right now, I'm really looking for a JBOD solution, so I'm going to pass on the new Drobo for now.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicmultidock\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/multidock.jpg\" alt=\"multidock\" width=\"277\" height=\"40\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-296\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Blackmagic MultiDock</strong> - around $600 empty\r\nI find the <a href=\"http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicmultidock\">Blackmagic MultiDock</a> very interesting. It offers four 2.5-inch bays in a 1U rackmount enclosure. It's designed to be used with really fast SSD drives, primarily for video editors. While I do have an audio rack next to my desk for rackmount devices like this, I'm just a video hobbyist and I don't have a stack of SSDs looking for a home. If BlackMagic or someone else made a version of this device that had 3.5-inch bays, I'd definitely be interested. And as SSDs get cheaper, I'll definitely give this another look.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?id=10607\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/lacie.jpg\" alt=\"lacie\" width=\"190\" height=\"174\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-299\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>LaCie 5big</strong> - around $1100 with 10TB\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?id=10607\">LaCie 5big</a> is a 5-bay Thunderbolt device that ships pre-filled with five 2TB drives for $1100 (or you can get a 20TB version for $2100). However, it doesn't support RAID 5, which I'd like to have as an option in the future. It does support JBOD, which is what I'm looking for right now, but they don't make an empty version, so I'd be forced to buy drives that I don't need. So this device is a pass for me.\r\n\r\nAt long last, here's what I actually ended up buying:\r\n<a href=\"http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/M3QX2KIT0GB/\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/owc.jpg\" alt=\"owc\" width=\"275\" height=\"410\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-303\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>OWC Mercury Elite Pro Qx2</strong> - around $280 empty\r\nThe <a href=\"http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/M3QX2KIT0GB/\">OWC Mercury Elite Pro Qx2</a> is a four-bay enclosure that supports RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10, or JBOD. However, this device is NOT a thunderbolt device. What?! Well, in doing all this research, I came to the realization that to really take advantage of the speed of Thunderbolt, you have to use RAID. Regular drives just aren't fast enough to saturate the channel. But I'm not doing 4K multicam editing, so I'm not concerned about achieving thunderbolt level speeds, and I don't want to set up a RAID device at this point. I just want a way to have these existing drives all attached to my MacBook without buying an enclosure and power supply for each one. This device does exactly that. The connectivity is Firewire 800 and USB 3. It has an internal power supply, so there's no power brick to deal with. And it has a nice big fan, so it should be pretty quiet. (Small fans have to spin faster and are thus usually noisier.) And it's considerably cheaper than all the Thunderbolt options I found.\r\n\r\nOne concern is being able to use this device with the new Mac Pro should I decide to get one. The new Mac Pro has USB 3, so I might connect it that way instead, and <a href=\"http://terrywhite.com/firewire-800-vs-usb-3-which-is-faster/\">it might even be faster than Firewire</a>. However, the OWC device only supports JBOD over Firewire, not USB. Fortunately, my Thunderbolt display provides a Firewire port, so if I want to continue using JBOD then I'll just connect it to the display.\r\n\r\nIt should arrive some time this week, so I'll update this article with my review of the device after I've spent some time with it.\r\n\r\nIf you have experience with any of the above devices, or if you have a Thunderbolt device you'd recommend to others, please let me know in the comments below.\r\n\r\n ",

This is similar to RAID 5, but the Drobo requires basically no configuration, and lets you use drives of any size. The 5D is the first Drobo to support Thunderbolt. It also has a slot for an SSD card that accelerates transfer speed. Here again, <a href=\"http://www.larryjordan.biz/product-review-drobo-5d/\">Larry Jordan has an excellent review</a>.\r\n\r\nI already own the original 4-bay Firewire Drobo, but it is painfully slow and unusable for day-to-day work, so I've retired it to service as a media storage device attached directly to my Airport wifi base station. It sounds like the 5D is considerably faster, even fast enough for multicam video editing. But again, right now, I'm really looking for a JBOD solution, so I'm going to pass on the new Drobo for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The ARC-8050 is a bit pricey, and sounds like it's a bit tricky to configure. I'm also not impressed with the very un-Mac-like software it ships with. And since I'm considering moving to a new Mac Pro in the near future, I'm going to keep my eyes on this company and see if they release a Thunderbolt 2 version with better software.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.drobo.com/products/professionals/drobo-5d/\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/drobo.jpg\" alt=\"drobo\" width=\"200\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-293\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Drobo 5D</strong> - around $700 empty\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.drobo.com/products/professionals/drobo-5d/\">Drobo 5D</a> allows you to insert up to 5 drives and it stripes your data across all the drives for speed and redundancy.

Here again, <a href=\"http://www.larryjordan.biz/product-review-drobo-5d/\">Larry Jordan has an excellent review</a>.\r\n\r\nI already own the original 4-bay Firewire Drobo, but it is painfully slow and unusable for day-to-day work, so I've retired it to service as a media storage device attached directly to my Airport wifi base station. It sounds like the 5D is considerably faster, even fast enough for multicam video editing. But again, right now, I'm really looking for a JBOD solution, so I'm going to pass on the new Drobo for now.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicmultidock\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/multidock.jpg\" alt=\"multidock\" width=\"277\" height=\"40\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-296\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Blackmagic MultiDock</strong> - around $600 empty\r\nI find the <a href=\"http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicmultidock\">Blackmagic MultiDock</a> very interesting. It offers four 2.5-inch bays in a 1U rackmount enclosure. It's designed to be used with really fast SSD drives, primarily for video editors. While I do have an audio rack next to my desk for rackmount devices like this, I'm just a video hobbyist and I don't have a stack of SSDs looking for a home. If BlackMagic or someone else made a version of this device that had 3.5-inch bays, I'd definitely be interested.

It does support JBOD, which is what I'm looking for right now, but they don't make an empty version, so I'd be forced to buy drives that I don't need. So this device is a pass for me.\r\n\r\nWhat I've learned from doing all this research: to really take advantage of the speed of the Thunderbolt channel, you have to use RAID. Regular drives just aren't fast enough to saturate the channel. But I'm not concerned about the speed; I'm not doing 4K multicam editing. I just want a way to have these existing drives all attached to my MacBook without buying an enclosure and power supply for each one.\r\n\r\nSo here's what I actually ended up buying:\r\n<img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/prod_owcmercury_qx2_usb3.jpg\" alt=\"prod_owcmercury_qx2_usb3\" width=\"275\" height=\"320\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-300\" style=\"border:none\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/owc_qx2_usb3_gall2.jpg\" alt=\"owc_qx2_usb3_gall2\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-301\" style=\"border:none\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

This is an 8-bay minitower that supports every RAID level you can imagine, or you can use it as just a bunch of disks (JBOD). You can even mix and match, using some of the bays for a RAID config and others as independent disks. Final Cut guru Larry Jordan has written <a href=\"http://www.larryjordan.biz/product-review-areca-8050-thunderbolt-raid/\">a great review of the ARC-8050</a>. Areca also makes <a href=\"http://www.areca.us/products/thunderbolt5026.htm\">a similar device with just 4 bays</a> for around $850.\r\n\r\nWhile a fast RAID is great for video projects, that's not the problem I'm trying to solve right now. The ARC-8050 is a bit pricey, and sounds like it's a bit tricky to configure. I'm also not impressed with the very un-Mac-like software it ships with.

This is similar to RAID 5, but the Drobo requires basically no configuration, and lets you use drives of any size. The 5D is the first Drobo to support Thunderbolt. It also has a slot for an SSD card that accelerates transfer speed. Here again, <a href=\"http://www.larryjordan.biz/product-review-drobo-5d/\">Larry Jordan has an excellent review</a>.\r\n\r\nI already own the original 4-bay Firewire Drobo, but it is painfully slow and unusable for day-to-day work, so I've retired it to service as a media storage device attached directly to my Airport wifi base station. It sounds like the 5D is considerably faster, even fast enough for multicam video editing. But again, right now, I'm really looking for a JBOD solution, so I'm going to pass on the new Drobo for now.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicmultidock\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/multidock.jpg\" alt=\"multidock\" width=\"277\" height=\"40\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-296\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Blackmagic MultiDock</strong> - around $600 empty\r\nI find the <a href=\"http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicmultidock\">Blackmagic MultiDock</a> very interesting.

While I do have an audio rack next to my desk for rackmount devices like this, I'm just a video hobbyist and I don't have a stack of SSDs looking for a home. If BlackMagic or someone else made a version of this device that had 3.5-inch bays, I'd definitely be interested.

It does support JBOD, which is what I'm looking for right now, but they don't make an empty version, so I'd be forced to buy drives that I don't need.

However, this device is NOT a thunderbolt device. What?! Well, in doing all this research, I came to the realization that to really take advantage of the speed of Thunderbolt, you have to use RAID. Regular drives just aren't fast enough to saturate the channel. But I'm not doing 4K multicam editing, so I'm not concerned about achieving thunderbolt level speeds, and I don't want to set up a RAID device at this point. I just want a way to have these existing drives all attached to my MacBook without buying an enclosure and power supply for each one. This device does exactly that. The connectivity is Firewire 800 and USB 3. It has an internal power supply, so no power brick to deal with. And it has a nice big fan, so it should be pretty quiet. (Small fans have to spin faster and are thus usually noisier.) And it's considerably cheaper than all the Thunderbolt options I found.\r\n\r\nOne concern is being able to use this device with the new Mac Pro should I decide to get one. The new Mac Pro doesn't have Firewire, but my thunderbolt display provides a Firewire 800 port, so I can use that as a bridge. The OWC device is also USB 3 capable, as is the new Mac Pro, so I might connect it that way instead, and <a href=\"http://terrywhite.com/firewire-800-vs-usb-3-which-is-faster/\">it might even be faster</a>.\r\n\r\nIt should arrive some time this week, so I'll update this article with my review of the device after I've spent some time with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

    "post_content": "I've finally retired my aging Mac Pro tower. I bought the 8-core model in April 2007, and managed to keep it feeling quite snappy with a few upgrades along the way: 17gb of RAM, a 500mb SSD drive, and a new video card. I also retired my 30-inch cinema display from 2004.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm considering making the leap to <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/\">the new Mac Pro tower</a> that should be released any day now, I'm currently using my 2011 MacBook Pro full-time, along with a 27-inch Thunderbolt display, and it's doing the job pretty well. (I installed the SSD from the old Mac Pro, and maxed the RAM at 16gb.) So I might stick with this and not bother getting the new Mac Pro.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I really miss is the three extra drive bays in the old Mac Pro. In the second bay I had a pretty fast data drive for my everyday projects and my large iTunes and iPhoto libraries. In the third bay, a really fast drive dedicated to Final Cut Pro projects. And in the fourth bay, a 3TB drive for Time Machine Backups. (I also use SuperDuper to backup my startup drive nightly; and after every Final Cut session, I'd backup my video drive to an external drive via a NewerTech drive dock.\r\n\r\nSo now that I have a Thunderbolt-capable machine, I've been exploring the available options for getting all those drives online with my new rig. I'm looking for a simple drive expansion chassis, something that will allow me to use all these drives without having a stack of external enclosures and power cables cluttering my desk. Here's what I've found.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.areca.us/products/thunderbolt.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ARC-8050.jpg\" alt=\"ARC-8050\" width=\"170\" height=\"307\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-287\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Areca ARC-8050</strong> – around $1450 empty\r\nAt the top of the list, the <a href=\"http://www.areca.us/products/thunderbolt.htm\">ARC-8050 by Areca</a>. This is an 8-bay minitower that supports every RAID level you can imagine, or you can use it as just a bunch of disks (JBOD). You can even mix and match, using some of the bays for a RAID config and others as independent disks. Final Cut guru Larry Jordan has written <a href=\"http://www.larryjordan.biz/product-review-areca-8050-thunderbolt-raid/\">a great review of the ARC-8050</a>. Areca also makes <a href=\"http://www.areca.us/products/thunderbolt5026.htm\">a similar device with just 4 bays</a> for around $850.\r\n\r\nWhile a fast RAID is great for video projects, that's not the problem I'm trying to solve right now. The ARC-8050 is a bit pricey, and sounds like it's a bit tricky to configure. I'm also not impressed with the very un-Mac-like software it ships with. And since I'm considering moving to a new Mac Pro in the near future, I'm going to keep my eyes on this company and see if they release a Thunderbolt 2 version with better software.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.drobo.com/products/professionals/drobo-5d/\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/drobo.jpg\" alt=\"drobo\" width=\"200\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-293\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Drobo 5D</strong> - around $700 empty\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.drobo.com/products/professionals/drobo-5d/\">Drobo 5D</a> allows you to insert up to 5 drives and it stripes your data across all the drives for speed and redundancy. This is similar to RAID 5, but the Drobo requires basically no configuration, and lets you use drives of any size. The 5D is the first Drobo to support Thunderbolt. It also has a slot for an SSD card that accelerates transfer speeds. Here again, <a href=\"http://www.larryjordan.biz/product-review-drobo-5d/\">Larry Jordan has an excellent review</a>.\r\n\r\nI already own the original 4-bay Firewire Drobo, but it is painfully slow and unusable for day-to-day work, so I've retired it to service as a media storage device attached directly to my Airport wifi base station. It sounds like the 5D is considerably faster, even fast enough for multicam video editing. But again, right now, I'm really looking for a JBOD solution, so I'm going to pass on the new Drobo for now.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicmultidock\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/multidock.jpg\" alt=\"multidock\" width=\"277\" height=\"40\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-296\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Blackmagic MultiDock</strong> - around $600 empty\r\nI find the <a href=\"http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicmultidock\">Blackmagic MultiDock</a> very interesting. It offers four 2.5-inch bays in a 1U rackmount enclosure. It's designed to be used with really fast SSD drives, primarily for video editors. While I do have an audio rack next to my desk for rackmount devices like this, I'm just a video hobbyist and I don't have a stack of SSDs looking for a home. If BlackMagic or someone else made a version of this device that had 3.5-inch bays, I'd definitely be interested. And as SSDs get cheaper, I'll definitely give this another look.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?id=10607\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/lacie.jpg\" alt=\"lacie\" width=\"190\" height=\"174\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-299\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>LaCie 5big</strong> - around $1100 with 10TB\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?id=10607\">LaCie 5big</a> is a 5-bay Thunderbolt device that ships pre-filled with five 2TB drives for $1100 (or you can get a 20TB version for $2100). However, it doesn't support RAID-5 which I'd like to have as an option in the future. It does support JBOD, which is what I'm looking for right now, but they don't make an empty version, so I'd be forced to buy drives that I don't need. So this device is a pass for me.\r\n\r\nAt long last, here's what I actually ended up buying:\r\n<a href=\"http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/M3QX2KIT0GB/\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/owc.jpg\" alt=\"owc\" width=\"275\" height=\"410\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-303\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/M3QX2KIT0GB/\">OWC Mercury Elite Pro Qx2</a></strong> - around $280 empty\r\n\r\nThis is a four-bay enclosure that supports RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10, or JBOD. However, this device is NOT a thunderbolt device. What?! Well, in doing all this research, I came to the realization that to really take advantage of the speed of Thunderbolt, you have to use RAID. Regular drives just aren't fast enough to saturate the channel. But I'm not doing 4K multicam editing, so I'm not concerned about achieving thunderbolt level speeds, and I don't want to set up a RAID device at this point. I just want a way to have these existing drives all attached to my MacBook without buying an enclosure and power supply for each one. This device does exactly that. The connectivity is Firewire 800 and USB 3. It has an internal power supply, so no power brick to deal with. And it has a nice big fan, so it should be pretty quiet. (Small fans have to spin faster and are thus usually noisier.) And it's considerably cheaper than all the Thunderbolt options I found.\r\n\r\nOne concern is being able to use this device with the new Mac Pro should I decide to get one. The new Mac Pro doesn't have Firewire, but my thunderbolt display provides a Firewire 800 port, so I can use that as a bridge. The OWC device is also USB 3 capable, as is the new Mac Pro, so I might connect it that way instead, and <a href=\"http://terrywhite.com/firewire-800-vs-usb-3-which-is-faster/\">it might even be faster than Firewire</a>.\r\n\r\nIt should arrive some time this week, so I'll update this article with my review of the device after I've spent some time with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

Regular drives just aren't fast enough to saturate the channel. But I'm not doing 4K multicam editing, so I'm not concerned about achieving thunderbolt level speeds, and I don't want to set up a RAID device at this point. I just want a way to have these existing drives all attached to my MacBook without buying an enclosure and power supply for each one. This device does exactly that. The connectivity is Firewire 800 and USB 3. It has an internal power supply, so there's no power brick to deal with. And it has a nice big fan, so it should be pretty quiet. (Small fans have to spin faster and are thus usually noisier.) And it's considerably cheaper than all the Thunderbolt options I found.\n\nOne concern is being able to use this device with the new Mac Pro should I decide to get one. The new Mac Pro has USB 3, so I might connect it that way instead, and <a href=\"http://terrywhite.com/firewire-800-vs-usb-3-which-is-faster/\">it might even be faster than Firewire</a>. However, the OWC device doesn't support JBOD over USB, only over Firewire. Fortunately, my Thunderbolt display provides a Firewire port, so if want to continue using JBOD then I'll just connect it to the display.\n\nIt should arrive some time this week, so I'll update this article with my review of the device after I've spent some time with it.\n\nIf you have experience with any of the above devices, or if you have a Thunderbolt device you'd recommend to others, please let me know in the comments below.\n\n ",

I bought the 8-core model in April 2007, and managed to keep it feeling quite snappy with a few upgrades along the way: 17gb of RAM, a 500mb SSD drive, and a new video card. I also retired my 30-inch cinema display from 2004.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm considering making the leap to <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/\">the new Mac Pro tower</a> that should be released any day now, I'm currently using my 2011 MacBook Pro full-time, along with a 27-inch Thunderbolt display, and it's doing the job pretty well. (I installed the SSD from the old Mac Pro, and maxed the RAM at 16gb.) So I might stick with this and not bother getting the new Mac Pro.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I really miss is the three extra drive bays in the old Mac Pro. In the second bay I had a pretty fast data drive for my everyday projects and my large iTunes and iPhoto libraries. In the third bay, a really fast drive dedicated to Final Cut Pro projects. And in the fourth bay, a 3TB drive for Time Machine Backups. (I also use SuperDuper to backup my startup drive nightly; and after every Final Cut session, I'd backup my video drive to an external drive via a NewerTech drive dock.\r\n\r\nSo now that I have a Thunderbolt-capable machine, I've been exploring the available options for getting all those drives online with my new rig. I'm looking for a simple drive expansion chassis, something that will allow me to use all these drives without having a stack of external enclosures and power cables cluttering my desk. Here's what I've found.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.areca.us/products/thunderbolt.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ARC-8050.jpg\" alt=\"ARC-8050\" width=\"170\" height=\"307\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-287\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Areca ARC-8050</strong> – around $1450 empty\r\nAt the top of the list, the <a href=\"http://www.areca.us/products/thunderbolt.htm\">ARC-8050 by Areca</a>. This is an 8-bay minitower that supports every RAID level you can imagine, or you can use it as just a bunch of disks (JBOD). You can even mix and match, using some of the bays for a RAID config and others as independent disks. Final Cut guru Larry Jordan has written <a href=\"http://www.larryjordan.biz/product-review-areca-8050-thunderbolt-raid/\">a great review of the ARC-8050</a>. Areca also makes <a href=\"http://www.areca.us/products/thunderbolt5026.htm\">a similar device with just 4 bays</a> for around $850.\r\n\r\nWhile a fast RAID is great for video projects, that's not the problem I'm trying to solve right now. The ARC-8050 is a bit pricey, and sounds like it's a bit tricky to configure. I'm also not impressed with the very un-Mac-like software it ships with.

This is similar to RAID 5, but the Drobo requires basically no configuration, and lets you use drives of any size. The 5D is the first Drobo to support Thunderbolt. It also has a slot for an SSD card that accelerates transfer speeds. Here again, <a href=\"http://www.larryjordan.biz/product-review-drobo-5d/\">Larry Jordan has an excellent review</a>.\r\n\r\nI already own the original 4-bay Firewire Drobo, but it is painfully slow and unusable for day-to-day work, so I've retired it to service as a media storage device attached directly to my Airport wifi base station.

But again, right now, I'm really looking for a JBOD solution, so I'm going to pass on the new Drobo for now.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicmultidock\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/multidock.jpg\" alt=\"multidock\" width=\"277\" height=\"40\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-296\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Blackmagic MultiDock</strong> - around $600 empty\r\nI find the <a href=\"http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicmultidock\">Blackmagic MultiDock</a> very interesting.

I just want a way to have these existing drives all attached to my MacBook without buying an enclosure and power supply for each one. This device does exactly that. The connectivity is Firewire 800 and USB 3. It has an internal power supply, so there's no power brick to deal with. And it has a nice big fan, so it should be pretty quiet. (Small fans have to spin faster and are thus usually noisier.) And it's considerably cheaper than all the Thunderbolt options I found.\r\n\r\nOne concern is being able to use this device with the new Mac Pro should I decide to get one. The new Mac Pro doesn't have Firewire, but my thunderbolt display provides a Firewire 800 port, so I can use that as a bridge.

So I might stick with this and not bother getting the new Mac Pro.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I really miss is the three extra drive bays in the old Mac Pro.

I'm looking for a simple drive expansion chassis, something that will allow me to use all these drives without having a stack of external enclosures and power cables cluttering my desk. Here's what I've found.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.areca.us/products/thunderbolt.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ARC-8050.jpg\" alt=\"ARC-8050\" width=\"170\" height=\"307\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-287\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Areca ARC-8050</strong> – around $1450 empty\r\nAt the top of the list, the <a href=\"http://www.areca.us/products/thunderbolt.htm\">ARC-8050 by Areca</a>. This is an 8-bay minitower that supports every RAID level you can imagine, or you can use it as just a bunch of disks (JBOD). You can even mix and match, using some of the bays for a RAID config and others as independent disks. Final Cut guru Larry Jordan has written <a href=\"http://www.larryjordan.biz/product-review-areca-8050-thunderbolt-raid/\">a great review of the ARC-8050</a>. Areca also makes <a href=\"http://www.areca.us/products/thunderbolt5026.htm\">a similar device with just 4 bays</a> for around $850.\r\n\r\nWhile a fast RAID is great for video projects, that's not the problem I'm trying to solve right now. The ARC-8050 is a bit pricey, and sounds like it's a bit tricky to configure. I'm also not impressed with the very un-Mac-like software it ships with. And since I'm considering moving to a new Mac Pro in the near future, I'm going to keep my eyes on this company and see if they release a Thunderbolt 2 version with better software.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.drobo.com/products/professionals/drobo-5d/\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/drobo.jpg\" alt=\"drobo\" width=\"200\" height=\"169\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-293\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Drobo 5D</strong> - around $700 empty\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.drobo.com/products/professionals/drobo-5d/\">Drobo 5D</a> allows you to insert up to 5 drives and it stripes your data across all the drives for speed and redundancy. This is similar to RAID 5, but the Drobo requires basically no configuration, and lets you use drives of any size. The 5D is the first Drobo to support Thunderbolt. It also has a slot for an SSD card that accelerates transfer speeds. Here again, <a href=\"http://www.larryjordan.biz/product-review-drobo-5d/\">Larry Jordan has an excellent review</a>.\r\n\r\nI already own the original 4-bay Firewire Drobo, but it is painfully slow and unusable for day-to-day work, so I've retired it to service as a media storage device attached directly to my Airport wifi base station. It sounds like the 5D is considerably faster, even fast enough for multicam video editing. But again, right now, I'm really looking for a JBOD solution, so I'm going to pass on the new Drobo for now.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicmultidock\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/multidock.jpg\" alt=\"multidock\" width=\"277\" height=\"40\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-296\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>Blackmagic MultiDock</strong> - around $600 empty\r\nI find the <a href=\"http://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicmultidock\">Blackmagic MultiDock</a> very interesting. It offers four 2.5-inch bays in a 1U rackmount enclosure. It's designed to be used with really fast SSD drives, primarily for video editors. While I do have an audio rack next to my desk for rackmount devices like this, I'm just a video hobbyist and I don't have a stack of SSDs looking for a home. If BlackMagic or someone else made a version of this device that had 3.5-inch bays, I'd definitely be interested. And as SSDs get cheaper, I'll definitely give this another look.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?id=10607\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/lacie.jpg\" alt=\"lacie\" width=\"190\" height=\"174\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-299\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>LaCie 5big</strong> - around $1100 with 10TB\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.lacie.com/us/products/product.htm?id=10607\">LaCie 5big</a> is a 5-bay Thunderbolt device that ships pre-filled with five 2TB drives for $1100 (or you can get a 20TB version for $2100). However, it doesn't support RAID 5, which I'd like to have as an option in the future. It does support JBOD, which is what I'm looking for right now, but they don't make an empty version, so I'd be forced to buy drives that I don't need. So this device is a pass for me.\r\n\r\nAt long last, here's what I actually ended up buying:\r\n<a href=\"http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/M3QX2KIT0GB/\"><img src=\"http://www.pascal.com/diary/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/owc.jpg\" alt=\"owc\" width=\"275\" height=\"410\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-303\" style=\"border:none\" /></a>\r\n<strong>OWC Mercury Elite Pro Qx2</strong> - around $280 empty\r\nThe <a href=\"http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/M3QX2KIT0GB/\">OWC Mercury Elite Pro Qx2</a> is a four-bay enclosure that supports RAID 0, 1, 5, and 10, or JBOD. However, this device is NOT a thunderbolt device. What?! Well, in doing all this research, I came to the realization that to really take advantage of the speed of Thunderbolt, you have to use RAID. Regular drives just aren't fast enough to saturate the channel. But I'm not doing 4K multicam editing, so I'm not concerned about achieving thunderbolt level speeds, and I don't want to set up a RAID device at this point. I just want a way to have these existing drives all attached to my MacBook without buying an enclosure and power supply for each one. This device does exactly that. The connectivity is Firewire 800 and USB 3. It has an internal power supply, so there's no power brick to deal with. And it has a nice big fan, so it should be pretty quiet. (Small fans have to spin faster and are thus usually noisier.) And it's considerably cheaper than all the Thunderbolt options I found.\r\n\r\nOne concern is being able to use this device with the new Mac Pro should I decide to get one. The new Mac Pro has USB 3, so I might connect it that way instead, and <a href=\"http://terrywhite.com/firewire-800-vs-usb-3-which-is-faster/\">it might even be faster than Firewire</a>. However, the OWC device only supports JBOD over Firewire, not USB. Fortunately, my Thunderbolt display provides a Firewire port, so if I want to continue using JBOD then I'll just connect it to the display.\r\n\r\nIt should arrive some time this week, so I'll update this article with my review of the device after I've spent some time with it.\r\n\r\nIf you have experience with any of the above devices, or if you have a Thunderbolt device you'd recommend to others, please let me know in the comments below.\r\n\r\n ",
