Last night I went to dinner and then <a href="http://pictures.pascal.com/gallery/fourparties">FOUR PARTIES</a>. It was fun, but in general I wouldn’t recommend doing this. Much better to pick a party and stick with it. Certainly it felt glamorous hopping from party to cab and from cab to party, but somehow I think I would have had more fun if I’d stayed in one place. Parties are like relationships – you have to commit to them and put some effort into them before you can have sex with them. Well, you know what I mean.
