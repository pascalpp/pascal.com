(Apologies if you’re on my music mailing list and you already read this…)

I finally made it! This is it! The BIG TIME! My name in lights! Next stop,

NEW YORK CITY!

Oh wait, I’m already in New York City.

Well anyway, you can now get your grubby mitts on my first album on the

iTunes Music Store. So if you’ve got iTunes installed, grab your grubby

mouse and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=7202482">click here</a>.

If you don’t have iTunes installed, go get it, here:

In other news, work on my next album is progressing very nicely. My sister

Lauren came up from Florida for a week to record with me, and my friend

Rose Polenzani from Boston came down for a couple days as well. Together

they wrote some amazing harmonies for one of the songs. Lauren and I also

wrote a song together, and Rose played Rhodes on a couple of songs as

well. My friends Josh and Chris laid down some guitar and bass tracks, and

my friends Peter and Paul will be coming up from Alabama for a week later

this month to keep the record rolling. My roommate Kyle (of Rainer Maria)

is gonna help mix and I’m hoping he’ll do some tracking as well. I hope to

have the whole thing done by the end of September and in stores by

Christmas! So stay tuned…

And tell your friends to <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=7202482">buy my record</a>!
