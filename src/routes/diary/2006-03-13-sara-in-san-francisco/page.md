Sara is coming to visit me in San Francisco in a couple days. We’re gonna head down the coast to a little town called Cambria for a couple days, and then we’re coming back to SF to roam around some of my old haunts and eat in some of my favorite restaurants. I can’t wait.

I love Sara. She’s the awesome.
