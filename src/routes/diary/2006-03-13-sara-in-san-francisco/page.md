Sara is coming to visit me in San Francisco in a couple days. We’re gonna head down the coast to a little town called Cambria for a couple days, and then we’re coming back to SF to roam around some of my old haunts and eat in some of my favorite restaurants. I can’t wait.

I love Sara. She’s the awesome.

<div class="commentbody">hey pascal! (I tried your email address but it bounced back invalid.)  I was simply wasting time on itunes and somehow saw your name and music. it sounds great! i was suddenly remembering bringing pots and pans to state st, makin’ noise and screaming out mr. jenkins with you about bar time. criminy, was that really 10 years ago? if you see this i’d love to hear from you, or if you come through madison I am still stuck here!</div> -->
