Bush is not a conservative by any real definition of the word. He’s wasteful and reckless.

Bush is of a class called neo-conservatives. They hold a very different world view from traditional conservatives. They foster a very aggressive foreign policy in which America takes a very active role in foreign affairs, from regime change to nation-building. Neo-cons are largely unconcerned with the roles our allies might play in these affairs. They are happy to act unilaterally, without subjecting their decisions to a “global test”. They hate tests. And they make bad neighbors.

Some traditional conservatives are starting to point out the risks of staying the course the neo-cons have laid out for us. Among them is Brent Scowcroft, security advisor to President Bush the First, who has called Bush the Second’s foray into Iraq <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-10-16-failing-venture_x.htm">’a failing venture’</a>.
