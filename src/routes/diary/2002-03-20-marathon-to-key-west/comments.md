<div class="commentbody">Pascal,     03-23-02  You have a great site.  I was looking up Pascal Compilers and decided to try WWW.Pascal.com and fumbled across your site.  It is freezing in New England with 4” of snow on the ground and wind chill of about 18 degrees.  So I really enjoyed your Florida photographs.   I went to the University of South Florida in Tampa and my roomate and I sailed from Saint Augustine to Miami several times in college.  Your photographs are great.  What system are you using?  If you are to busy to respond I understand.  Happy sailing!  Best regards, Phil Sidney Shirley, Massachusetts (50 Min. NW of Boston) users.rcn.com/philsidney/</div>
