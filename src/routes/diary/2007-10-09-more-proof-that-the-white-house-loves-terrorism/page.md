Remember the hullabaloo a few weeks back when it was announced that Osama Bin Laden was releasing a new video tape?

Turns out that a small private intelligence company, the SITE intelligence group, was able to exploit a security breach to gain access to Al Qaeda communications and thereby learned not only that a new Bin Laden video was about to be released, but also the content of the video itself.

Upon gaining this information, SITE alerted White House officials, on condition that they not reveal the information until Al Qaeda released the tape, so as not to alert them that their network security had been breached.

And what did the White House do with this information? Did they try to follow up on the security exploit to gain further information? No, they decided to terrorize the American public as soon as possible by alerting FOX News. As a result, Al Qaeda learned of the intrusion and added more security to end the exploit.

Who are the terrorists?
