Okay so we finished the tour and we all went home.

Then I moved to New York. Brooklyn, specifically.

So far I’m loving New York and I’m never ever ever going to leave.

I played my first New York show the other night, at the Knitting Factory. That was super fun.

Okay, so that’s all you need to know for now.
