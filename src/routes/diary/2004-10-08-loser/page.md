George W. Bush bankrupted two Texas oil companies and as governor, he even bankrupted the Treasury of the great state of Texas. As owner of the Texas Rangers he made the brilliant move of trading away Sammy Sosa. Now he’s running our <b>country</b> into the ground.

Having inherited a record budget surplus from the prior administration, he’s miraculously parlayed that into a record deficit by giving huge tax cuts to his rich friends (and $300 to suckers like you and me) and spending billions of dollars destroying the infrastructure in Iraq so he could divert more billions of dollars into no-bid contracts for his buddies’ companies to rebuild that same infrastructure.

Let’s ditch this fuckin LOSER.
