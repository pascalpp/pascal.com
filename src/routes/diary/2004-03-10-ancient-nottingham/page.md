I used to live at this wonderfully wacky place in Madison called Nottingham Co-op. Nottingham was incorporated in 1971 in this weird old house on Lake Mendota, off Langdon Street near the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. Prior to this, the building was occupied by a fraternity that went bankrupt in the late 60s or early 70s. Prior to that, I understand that the building served as a home for a sorority or womenâ€™s shelter (or perhaps both) and before that, another fraternity (or perhaps the same one that later took occupancy). I believe the building was originally erected as a private residence in the late 1910s or in the 1920s.

I registered the domain <a href="http://www.nottingham.org">nottingham.org</a> some time ago, and tonite I was just checking in to see what the kids were doing with their website. I came across this page of pictures from before Nottingham was Nottingham. <a href="http://www.nottingham.org/pics/38/index.html">You have to check it out.</a>
