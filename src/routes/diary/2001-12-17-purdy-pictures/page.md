I think today we’ll just look at some pictures.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./sunrise-fortgeorge.jpg" /></p>

Just before sunrise on the Fort George River where we anchored last night.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./birdsmigrating.jpg" /></p>

Some kind of birds migrating south. Of course they may have been lining up to spell ‘Willow’, but we didn’t have time to stick around and find out.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./valerie-stern.jpg" /></p>

Valerie handling lines on the stern as we prepare to leave Fort George River.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./clouds.jpg" /></p>

Pretty clouds.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./drawbridge.jpg" /></p>

Passing through one of the many drawbridges on the ICW.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./scrubbing-topsides.jpg" /></p>

Nick holds me out of the drink while i give the topsides a scrub.
