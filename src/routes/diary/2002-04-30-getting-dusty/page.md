Okay so I been fallin down on the job here…

Let’s see where am I?

Well, some time in late March I took my leave of Willow for the time being and headed home to Alabama to visit my family. Nick and Valerie are making arrangements to have the boat delivered to the Virgin Islands, where they will fly to meet it. From there I believe they’ll head south to Trinidad and Tobago or thereabouts, to get out of the hurricane belt by June or so.

Unfortunately I don’t think I’ll be joining them, at least not anytime soon.

Instead, I’ve decided to move to Birmingham and work on music full time. I’ll be posting some recent photos sometime soon.

<div class="commentbody">Hi Pascal,     Bummer that you’re not doing the sailing thing anymore, I was living vicariously through you for the time being. (hope ya don’t mind!) Music idea sounds great though, I’d love to do something with music, but I think I need to learn more than 6 chords! Still planning on doing something with Ryan in the future? (he mentioned you might try to do a CD together)   I really like your Satellite song.  I didn’t think it would play through my computer, but I downloaded it anyway and then went about doing something else and about 10 minutes later there’s this guy singing in my shack!  (that be you!)  It sounded great, post some more songs if you get a chance. :) Tell Nick and Valerie to look us up out here in Coral Bay when they make it down to the islands. Best of luck with your music!   P.S. hope you kept the “too small” vest, it looked hot!  :)</div>
