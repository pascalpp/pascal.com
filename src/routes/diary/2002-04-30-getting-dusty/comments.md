<div class="commentbody">Hi Pascal,     Bummer that you’re not doing the sailing thing anymore, I was living vicariously through you for the time being. (hope ya don’t mind!) Music idea sounds great though, I’d love to do something with music, but I think I need to learn more than 6 chords! Still planning on doing something with Ryan in the future? (he mentioned you might try to do a CD together)   I really like your Satellite song.  I didn’t think it would play through my computer, but I downloaded it anyway and then went about doing something else and about 10 minutes later there’s this guy singing in my shack!  (that be you!)  It sounded great, post some more songs if you get a chance. :) Tell Nick and Valerie to look us up out here in Coral Bay when they make it down to the islands. Best of luck with your music!   P.S. hope you kept the “too small” vest, it looked hot!  :)</div>
