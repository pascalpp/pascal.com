<div class="commentbody">These brave men and women were all volunteers who died for something�in which�they believed.��Using the term�”losers” anywhere around the names of these brave�soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen�is a�disgrace.� These�men and women fought�and died for not only what�our country requested but for each other.� They did not go to war�and die for George W. Bush, they fought and died for each other.��It is a disgrace to�use the�names of these brave men and�women�for immature political rhetoric.���</div>

<div class="commentbody">i’m sorry, john. i in no way meant to imply that these soldiers are ‘losers’ in a pejorative sense. i was speaking in regard to the winning or losing of an election in which they had no voice.

i have read accounts of MANY MANY soldiers from iraq who have come home to speak out against what is happening there. If you wish to read some of those accounts, i can point you at <a href="http://optruth.org">http://optruth.org</a> as one example.

you may claim i’m using the names of these soldiers as a political tool; i believe that in fact it is this administration that has used their lives as political tools. i am merely pointing that out. out of respect for their lives and in hopes of saving the lives of the soldiers who are still in iraq, i respectfully decline to remove the entry. </div>

<div class="commentbody">Ironic, and sad. These are just the people whose perspective and efforts should’ve warranted them a voice in what was happening to them, and which way this country will go in the next four years. Too bad we can’t get Sylvia Brown to channel their voices from beyond the grave. I think we’d hear a lot of yelling.</div>

<div class="commentbody">I agree with John F. and I would like to add that if these brave men and women had been able to vote they would have most likely voted overwhelmingly republican, as is traditonally the case with military personnel. Probably why Gore did his best to block overseas military ballots in Florida, while at the same time he wanted heavily populated democrat areas in Florida counted multiple times. Even to have ballots that had not been punched through to be judged how the person wanted to vote. That’s the clearest example of hypocrisy I’ve ever seen.</div>

<div class="commentbody">Proud to say that my brother-in-law, Josiah Vandertulip, cast his absentee ballot for Bush prior to his death. We are so proud of him and are honored by his sacrifice. He died doing what he believed in. He died so that you may remain free.</div>

<div class="commentbody">Sorry Vandertulip - I’d still be free, even if your brother in law hadn’t died in Iraq.  I believe I’d still be as free as I am now, even if none of those listed had died.

In fact, we’d all be alot more free if none of these fine young men had died:

“Naturally, the common people dont want war, but after all, it is the leaders of a country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy, or fascist dictatorship, or a parlament, or communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.”

–Hermann Goering. Hitler’s Reich-Marshall, quoted at the Nuremberg Trials.

Our brave young men ARE dying in VAIN at best, and are dying as a tool to take away our freedmons at worst. Failure to see that, even as a possiblity, gaurantees that many young men will continue to die in vain, and with each death we fall further into submission.

If these men are to risk their lives, and some of them are to die, we owe them the vigilance to ensure (and i mean be damn sure) that their deaths are not in vain.

“Those who give up liberty for the sake of security deserve neither liberty nor security.” –Ben Franklin.</div>

AND CHESTER AND IT CRIES OUT FROM HEAVEN FOR VENGEANCE. COME CALL ONE OF THESE BRAVE AND HONORABLE MEN AND WOMEN A LOOSER, COMPARE THEM TO A NAZI OR SAY THAT THEY DIED IN VAIN TO MY FACE AND, AT BEST, YOU WILL BE DRINKING YOUR MEALS THROUGH A STRAW FOR MANY MONTHS TO COME.

AND AS FAR AS BAMA’S CONCERN ABOUT ENEMY DEATH A SINGLE CENTCOM MWD HAS MORE HUMAN VALUE THAN ALL ENEMY DEAD. I DONT CARE HOW MANY IRAQIS DIE IF IT SAVES A SINGLE AMERICAN HUMAN OF CANINE LIFE. I WOULD HELP A SLIGHTLY INJURED CENTCOM MED BEFORE I WOULD HELP A DYING IRAQI INFANT.

AND IF YOU DONT LIKE THAT BAMA GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE US BECAUSE YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A ISLAMIC PIG SHIT RAGHEAD TRAITOR WHO SHOULD BE SWINGING AT THE END OF A ROPE FOR MURDER AND TREASON.</div>

<div class="commentbody">i am josiah vandertulip’s dad, and he did vote , he wasn’t a loser, and idiots like you didn’t get your freedoms from whining like little girls. the freedoms that we all treasure , were earned by the blood of soldiers in all previous conflicts. perhaps, the next time there is the threat of war , or we are attacked again, like on 9-11, you can go and protest in front of them until they give up. i’m sure that will be effective. robert vandertulip</div>

<div class="commentbody">Regardless of your opinion of war or who you wanted to win the presidential election, these men and women were killed while honoring YOU! Until you have personally lost someone you love for this cause, tread EXTREMELY lightly of how you define them. A loser is someone who amounts to nothing. A loser speaks without knowing the facts. Josiah Vandertulip DID vote. Josiah Vandertulip, and every other name on that list, did more for YOU and me than you can hope to accomplish in your entire life.</div>

I have lost 3 personal friends right here in Fallujah, Iraq. And I know for a fact that all of them voted on the recent election. I think we all know who the real loser is. And I can assure you that every service member would love to be at home with their families right now. But not all of them will ever have that privilege again. But they have made sure that you will have that privilege. </div>

Did you know any of the Fallen Soldiers for you to say that..THEY JOINED THE MILITARY TO SERVE AND PROTECT THEIR COUNTRY AT ANY COST… so Children and People like us, Yeah Like you to, can walk safely on the street without having to duck any Bombs or Bullets from Hostile Fire.  1st LT. OSCAR JIMENEZ, was a good Marine Soldier, Husband, Father, Son, Brother, Uncle, Cousine and a FRIEND.  He died on Sunday, April 11, 2004 under Hostile Fire from the Enemy in Prvence, Iraq. He saved lives that day…So were do you get the Losers and Vain from.

You do not know him, you do not know what he stood for and you certainly do not, nor do you have any invitation to second guess who he would have voted for.  He is not, nor has he ever been, a loser in anything.

Eric was extremely proud of what he was doing over there.  You need to study your history books and find out how the USA became the great place that it is.  The Iraqi people hope to get to be a great place also some day.  It doesn’t happen overnight.  I for one do not want Eric’s and all the others ultimate sacrifice to be for nothing.   </div>

He believed that what he was doing is Iraq was important and necessary.  And he had the courage of his convictions.  To parapharase, Courage is not the absence of fear but the belief that there is something more important than fear. This is how my son lived and how he died.  To call him a loser in any sense of the word is disrespectful. </div>

<div class="commentbody">I strongly agree with all those who are apposed to your list of ‘LOSERS.’ my little brother Carl F. Curran II, SPC USANG, whom was awarded the rank of SGT post humously along with many other awards. was not a loser. he was a proud young man who fought for what he believed was right. he has done that his whole life, enjoyed making people smile when something went bad… an example when Sept 11 happened.. he went into work wearing different goofy hats just to cheer people up… a santa hat, goofy’s hat with ears… whatever jsut to bring the morale back up.

even though he was unable to vote in that election does not give you the right to say that he was a loser among the rest who are not losers, those who have laid their lives down just so that we can remain free!!! and if your dubbing this list as loser’s to voting then you might as well look at all of our fellow veteran’s who have lost their lives in either wars (the great war, WWII, vietnam, korea… etc..) or just old age, you are dubbing them as losers as well. WHICH NONE OF THEM ARE!!! THEY ARE HEROS IN THEIR OWN RESPECTS!!! now i come from a line of military and i proudly serve!!! and i PROUDLY salute fallen comrades despite what branch they are in. marines, army, air force, navy, and coast guard!!! no matter waht we are in it together!!! and together we shall stand united against those who are against us!!! fair winds and flowing seas, until we see each other again!

<div class="commentbody">Soldier’s are the very one’s protecting your rights, freedoms and liberities / so you can express your views. Soldier’s do not lose his or her vote while in the military. Aan soldiers never want to go to war. Not one wants to wound and or kill another, nor to be wounded and or to be killed. So stop blaming the soldier for going yo war, and everything that happens in a war! you really have no one else to blame/  Sorry&lt; i was wrong you really do! Yourrself for starters and the American people for voting those into office.  These are the very people that sent our soldier’s to war.  So if you have a problem with the war. Then blame those youu elected. An stop with pinning the war on President George Bush. Congress and Senators voted to go to war.  Only several did not.  For all those that did, still you have to blame yourselve as an American.  If you truely, believe this war is wrong. An for those that voted to approve this war now changing his or her mind now. Hey, it’s election year and all he or she is really worried about is not being in Washington DC. So lets blame the President for misleading me.  No one mislead anyone. You have an education and you read all the paperwork needed to allow you to vote as you had wanted. Basically, those in Washington dc elected by the people do not care! My son didn’t died in avain! nor will I allow you or anyone to attempt to do that to him and all those he served so proudly with. </div>

He died an honorable young and belived that he was there for a purpose.  To keep you and others safe.  But jackasses like you have have failed to realize that World War I and World War II again kept us from having to fight here on our own soil.  Until the Americans have to fight that fight here at home we should be ever so thankful for our young men and women keeping our home land safe.  Even for idots like yourself.  Remember when you put your head down on your pillow at night.  He was the one guarding your rights and died for the same.

<div class="commentbody">Dear Sir,

I am the mother of PFC David P. Burridge. My son died on Sept 6, 2004 along side of 6 fellow Marine Brothers and 3 Iraq’s in training. 5 Marines survived that blast.

None of these men were losers in this election nor were they losers in any other fashion.

HOW DARE YOU!!!!!!!!

WHAT KIND OF PERSON ARE YOU!!!!!!!

I’ve read all that is printed on your diary. I read that people are asking and requesting the removaL of their LOVED ONE’S NAME from your list of losers, yet you do not remove them.

I personally am demanding the removal of my son’s name from your list as of today Octover 28, 2006.

I’ve gotten one Bill past here in Louisiana to stop idoits like you and others from using our Loved One’s names ans pictures for any use, policial or other wise. I’m now working on it in Congress. This would not allow people like you to slander, misuse, stc. the use of these wonderful loving soles names.

I for one did not get a call from you or any one else to see if you could use my son’s name. I could tell you now, I would not have given you permission.

I agree with everything my sister Michele Guidry had to say and I believe you sir have over stepped your boundries.

All of our brave military has had your back, why can’t you choose to have theirs.

Not in the political ring, just theirs.

Don’t associate their names with anything else accept honor, pride and a job well done when by the way you are safe and so is your family. For all of them that served, serving now or has passed on, made that possible.

I will be checking to see if my son’s name as well as others that have request the removal of their loved one’s name be removed. Has been removed.

Till them, sir - like my sister said,

GO STRAIGHT TO HELL

<div class="commentbody">I just want you to know that each and every one of them died to give you the freedom to post that on the internet today. I swelled with pride when I read each and every  one of those names. Not because of you’re “loser” remark, but knowing that my HUSBAND has also fought amongst the toughest of tough, so that you may speak freely. Remember this as you ridcule each and every respected soldier. </div>

I ask you again, remove the names.

<div class="commentbody">I am not speaking on anyone’s behalf. This is simply a list of the names of the soldiers who died in Iraq as of November 4, 2004. I copied the list from CNN’s website. Removing names from this list will not change anything. It will not bring them back. In fact, if this list were to be updated at all, it would be over three times longer.

Jeni, I am sorry for your loss, and for the loss of all those who knew any of the soldiers listed above, or any who have died since this list was posted.</div>

<div class="commentbody">What you are saying is offending many people whom have lost loved ones…and I think that you are no one whom should be mentioning their names in your so called agenda! You have no right what so ever! As a wife of an active duty soldier…these men and women believe they were there for a purpose. And if you are not an armed forces menber or have ever been then you should not be calling out these fallen heroes as losers! You are the loser my friend!</div>

<div class="commentbody">My wording was poor, and I’m sorry for that. But I’m not going to change the wording for the sake of posterity. These people are not losers. I was simply expressing a sentiment that it’s a shame that their voices were snuffed out and they were unable to vote. It has been since been pointed out that some of these soldiers voted absentee. So the premise of this post is erroneous in those cases. Nonetheless, for posterity’s sake, I’ve chosen to leave the list as it stands. Again, I’m sorry. I’ll not comment further on the matter.</div>

<div class="commentbody">Do not patronize me, Pascal. My children and I know FULL well that NOTHING will bring him back.

I am simply asking you to respect the wishes of the families left behind. Specifically, the names I’ve posted. Your refusal shows that you have absolutely NO respect for them or the Fallen.

As for not speaking on anones behalf, I call bullshit.

“Please remove my son�s name from your list: Spc Bradley S Beard was not a loser and in fact voted in the 2004 election. His absentee ballot was received and was counted. Thank you, Brad�s mom”

“Proud to say that my brother-in-law, Josiah Vandertulip, cast his absentee ballot for Bush prior to his death. We are so proud of him and are honored by his sacrifice. He died doing what he believed in. He died so that you may remain free.”

Now, in regards to Staff Sgt. Burdick, He PROUDLY served, fought, & ultimately gave his life for our country. He supported our president and the mission, and is in NO way a “loser”.</div>

<div class="commentbody">You really need to show me something on here were you have the permission to use these soldiers and marines names by them befor death or from their families. It is against the law to use the names of Fallen soldiers without permission from the family or prior death concent. If the families of these soldiers wanted to they could have your Butt in court over it because the military protects those soldiers and their family from “thrill seekers” or “spotlight stealers” such as yourself. I hope that because of the way you have used their names, each and every family that you have names of their fallen on here will nail your butt to the wall for this. Think about it!!</div>

YES my soldier went to war, YES fortunatley my soldier came back to me…we are still under that constent fear when that phone rings thats he gonna get called again. I don’t know where you were right to post this list. I get that your not calling the military men and woman losers, but come on do you get your jollies off just by seeing how many people that you can piss off from the time this lame excuse for attention was posted to whenever you feel is right to take it down? Come on guy, if you had any respect for ANY of the fallen heroes of this country or their families, you would show it. You are a POOR POOR excuse for an American. We should pack your shit up, arm you with an AK-47 and ship your ass over there and see how many of our PROUD SERVICE MEN and WOMEN who have read this are willing to turn on you…You are a poor excuse for a man….</div>

<div class="commentbody">I wonder if you, yourself, is married.  Or have children.  Can you just put yourself in the shoes of the families sufferring their losses?  This is pouring salt in SOOO many wounds, and it’s sadistic to continue this knowing now how much pain it’s causing.  It’s a hard thing to deal with, the deployments and losses, and something tells me you never have had to considering the lack of sensitivity, and for you to speak about something so devasting in such a personal way, without consideration for the persons closely related is so tactless and so thoughtless.  Just so you can make a statement, it is BEYOND OFFENSIVE!!  I wonder if you know, how many wives, mothers, brothers, cousins, friends you have made cry over a STUPID, MEANINGLESS comment.  I wonder if you noticed that you’re whole ‘purpose of raising awareness’ is doing nothing but bringing pain to the families of the fallen.  Is that what you wanted, because, if not, WHY DON’T YOU REMOVE IT????  You now know the pain you’re causing, yet, you choose to leave it up.  I know you could ‘make the same statement’ without using the names of the fallen, or re-opening wounds for so many grieving families.  These names are sacred to so many people, and your making light of that.  PLEASE STOP!  For the sake of the families.</div>

You shouls really take into consideration how you phrase sentences before you go around posting their names for your political stand point. My BEST FRIEND DIED DOING WHAT HE LOVED…..remember that. Remember these men are laying their lives on the line for this country and what it stands for…freedom and democracy. I truly hope that you will someday show some respect to those who you post on your page and realize their are family and friends of those couragous PROUD of what they did!!!!!</div> -->
