Tonight I made a [Pokemon viewer](/pokedex) in SvelteKit using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). My 9-year-old son is obsessed with Pokemon and I thought it would be fun to make a little app with him. Hoping he'll take an interest in adding new features and learning to code, but we'll see. So far he's mostly interested in looking at the pictures and clicking around and telling me which Pokemon evolved from which other Pokemon. ðŸ˜„
