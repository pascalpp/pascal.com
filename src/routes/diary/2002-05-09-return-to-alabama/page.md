At long last, here’s some of the photos I’ve taken since departing Willow.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./family.jpg" /></p>
Here’s my family, Erin, Ryan, Me, Lauren, and me dear mammy, as well as Erin’s dog Charlie and Mom’s dog Prancer.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./erin-charlie.jpg" /></p>
Erin and Charlie. Charlie is a girl. So is Erin.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./lauren-prancer.jpg" /></p>
Lauren and Prancer. Prancer is a boy. So is Lauren. No wait, she’s a girl.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./dogs.jpg" /></p>
Me and Charlie and Prancer and Peedee. Peedee is my brother’s dog. Peedee is a girl.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./peedee-passed-out.jpg" /></p>
Me and Peedee went out on the town, but she didn’t last long. A few drinks and she passed out in my sweatshirt.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./neworleans-ryan.jpg" /></p>
The following weekend I went to New Orleans with my nutty brother Ryan…

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./neworleans-sarah.jpg" /></p>
…and his nutty girlfriend Sarah…

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./neworleans-jazz.jpg" /></p>
We roamed around during the French Quarter Festival and listened to some awesome music. This is Doreen’s Jazz Band on Jackson Square…

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./kitchensyncopators.jpg" /></p>
…and this is the Kitchen Syncopators on one of the side streets in the quarter.

Have a listen:

Later that night we hit the town and knocked a few back.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./doinashot.jpg" /></p>
My brother was kind enough to buy me a drink, but he was also mean enough to stick it in this girl’s pants.

The rest of my trip to New Orleans is a bit of a blur and for some reason there aren’t any pictures.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./bigdog.jpg" /></p>
About a week later I went to Birmingham to visit some friends for a while. I saw this woman whose pet dog was so big that it had a pet dog of its own.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./petercatch.jpg" /></p>
I went to a friend’s blacksmith shop and played catch with my friend Peter.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./weldinggear.jpg" /></p>
Then I tried on some of the gear lying around.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./aviators.jpg" /></p>
Bad fuckin ass.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./nursinghome-wheelchairs.jpg" /></p>
A few days later we went to this creepy abandoned nursing home that my friends discovered. This is a closet full of old wheelchairs.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./nursinghome-lonechair.jpg" /></p>
This is the first wheelchair ever built, I think.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./nursinghome-reeltoreel.jpg" /></p>
There was an old reel-to-reel player with handwritten instructions.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./ultravan.jpg" /></p>
This is Peter and his girlfriend Mary standing next to an Ultravan that’s parked in their neighborhood. Later I met the guy who owns it, I guess there were only like 450 ever made and only 50 currently running. He and his wife traveled the states for 3 years in this one.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./paul-video.jpg" /></p>
Here’s my friend Paul working on one of many video projects. He’s an iMovie maestro.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./mepaulpaul.jpg" /></p>
Later me and Paul and his boyfriend Paul went out for Indian food. Mmm nummy.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./paulmonk.jpg" /></p>
This is Paul playing with his cat Monk. Sometimes they play rough.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./scaryfaces-0.jpg" /></p>
Then we made some scary faces. Click the picture to see more scaries. Note I gave myself another dang haircut.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./rufus.jpg" /></p>
Finally, Lauren and I went to Birmingham to see Rufus Wainwright in concert. He was awesome.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./rufusautograph.jpg" /></p>
After the show, we waited by the bus like good little groupies and Rufus signed my sister’s chest.

Aight, that’s all for now. Here, listen to some Rufus.
