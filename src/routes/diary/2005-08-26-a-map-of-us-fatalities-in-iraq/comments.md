<div class="commentbody">I appreciate the map you posted. It depicts the tragedy of this war and, going further, the absurdity of lives lost for a purpose so hollow and unjust.</div>

<div class="commentbody">If trying to give an oppressed people hope and freedom is unjust and hollow then I shutter to think what you do find worthy.  You can thank our friends who gave their lives in this war that you have the liberty to voice your misguided thoughts.  Our friends did not die in vain and shame on you that your words imply they did.</div>

<div class="commentbody">Wake up.  Of course they died in vain.  Are you serious?  And you want to know what’s worse?  Those of us who will never have anyone in our family sign up for the army don’t really care that your kid may die in vain.  To die for a country is in my mind a completely assinine thing to do.  At the end of the day I protect my family.  The hell if my kid is going to get himself killed to protect you or anyone else.  We praise people in the army because we’re so thankful that our kids aren’t going to get butchered.  We pity army people.  But, make no mistake.  We think you are idiots too.  Words like honor are meaningless when you kid died a horrible death in pain.  Why give birth if you are going to support them throwing themselves in front of bullets.  My kids will live.  They will do well in life.  Yours?  Who knows.  I hope so.  Hang on to what you need to. To get through that reality.  But your genes will eventually be wiped out with that approach to life. I’m glad for irrational people.  It improves my family’s likelihood of thriving in this world.</div>

<div class="commentbody">To the Army Wife that posted before, first, I hope your husband comes home in one piece (including mentally and emotionally along with physically.)

Second, you said that the one poster can thank your friends that have fought in this war and given their lives so that he can say what he said…………

Iraq was not a threat to his free speech. This administration is the threat. No other president cordoned off every city he goes to so that no one with dissenting views is within several blocks. No other administration has had people arrested for opening their mouth. When Bush rolls into a town, the SS has called everyone ahead of time and told them to take down anti bush signs. After 911 he came on TV and said “let’s not tolerate any talk about conspiracies….” We are not allowed to see or take pictures of the coffins coming home. When Newsweek printed the story (which they had cleared with 2 Whitehouse agencies) about the Koran being flushed (and there were 2 other news agencies that had already printed it), they were told by this administration to retract it.

Saddaam Hussein did not do all those things ma’am, George Bush and his administration did.

Go to my site and click on “Abuse of Powers” and tell me that we have free speech.

A WHITE HOUSE EMPLOYEE in broad daylight and on camera tells a man that is telling people about their CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS to cease doing that because he could “stir people up”

Dissent in not unpatriotic, it is our duty when we see something wrong, and boy-oh-boy is there something wrong…

And as for an issue which is close to home with you,let’s not get into Bush cutting VA funds and all that, let’s let you realize that on your own, but research as much as you can about what is going on in this country before posting that someone’s rights have been saved by a soldier in Iraq. </div>

<div class="commentbody">byteswap, you’re an idiot.  Examine the facts, and don’t resort to name calling, just because you think someones opinion is incorrect.  Plus, you’re probably just impotent.  Nooch!</div>

<div class="commentbody">Please for the love of god do not blame or hate the men who die for this country to be free. For you BARTON your speech is a good way to find your self in the cross hairs of a marine sniper. Its people like you that make me sick. How could you possible say that you are happy that someone died. Thats just sick. You are probably one of those sick bastards that protest at military funerals. Don’t worry cause those sick bastards are gonna have their day in front of my crosshairs. Thank the men who keep you free. Thank the men who keep you safe. I would love to see your opinion of your soldiers if some invading country came to you house and raped your wife and killed your kids. You would be thanking us then but that would never happen cause the MARINES stand at the gate ready to fight and die for what we believe in. God bless america and god bless the MARINES</div>

<div class="commentbody">To Melissa and Barton,

I cannot disagree with either of you more.

Melissa, I think you vision is short. We are fighting an extremist enemy who is both savage and ruthless. The enemy is not stupid. The enemy is patient.

We were attacked long before 9/11/2001. The WTC was attacked by a truck bomb. The USS Cole was attacked by a boat bomb. The Khobar towers were attacked by a truck bomb. And on and on. We did not start this war. To quit now is to give victory to the enemy.

Barton, you have my sympathy. Your selfish view makes you easy prey for the enemy that seeks to destroy you. I’m sure that there were lots of people who did not want their country to fight the Nazi war machine back in WWII. That did not stop the Nazis from coming anyway. While I could easily defend my family and home from the likes of you, I could not stop an enemy like terrorism alone. That is why we fight as a country.

To both of you, while I do strongly disagree with you both, I am glad that you enjoy and exercise the freedoms that my friends died for while we were in Iraq. It means that they did not die in vain. </div> -->
