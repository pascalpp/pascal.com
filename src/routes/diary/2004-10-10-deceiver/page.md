Bush’s air pollution legislation package – dubbed the “Clear Skies” initiative – actually rolls back environmental regulations on air pollution that have been in place for many years. Similarly, Bush’s “Healthy Forests” legislation makes it easier for timber companies to clear-cut old growth forests. The so-called “Patriot” Act abridges the rights of every patriotic American. These names are Orwellian in their deception. They claim to be one thing while in fact being quite the opposite – much like the “compassionate conservative” who brought them to us. This man has little compassion and has been far from conservative with our tax dollars and the lives of our soldiers. Lying, deceiving motherfucker.
