After I got back from New York, I drove to Tuscaloosa to visit my old friend Emily Lundin and her mom Anne. Here’s some pics I took while I was there.

Seems like mostly we went thrift store shopping. Here’s Emily in her new hot pink leather jacket.

Me trying on a striped shirt and a goofy face.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./03-anne-and-john.jpg" /></p>

Here’s Anne and her ‘friend’ hmm-hmm John. He just retired after working 30 years at Wisconsin Public Radio. He sure does have a radio voice. He drove all the way down from Wisconsin to see Anne. Isn’t that sweet?

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./04-anne-and-emily.jpg" /></p>

Emily told me to take a picture of her butt in these pants she was trying on. I obliged and then Anne stepped into the frame. Perfect!

Emily trying on a cool but kinda useless raincoat. She decided not to get it.

On Saturday night Emily and I went out on the town to cruise to Tuscaloosa bar scene. Here’s some of the bars we found.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./07-snickers-mcgee.jpg" /></p>

We spent most of our time in one bar, being very elitist and coming up with all kinds of suppositions about the lives of all the normal people around us. It was fun.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./08-normal-people.jpg" /></p>

Here’s us looking pretty normal…

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./09-not-so-normal-people.jpg" /></p>

…and not so normal. I think Emily won this one.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./10-at-the-waysider.jpg" /></p>

The next morning we went out for a nummy breakfast at the Waysider Inn, a Tuscaloosa tradition.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./11-cookie-contemplates-rain.jpg" /></p>

Then we had to drive Emily to the train station, and it rained on the way. Cookie contemplates the rain.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./13-emilys-special-brother.jpg" /></p>

Here’s Emily and her special brother. And Cookie.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./12-em-and-cookie.jpg" /></p>

Emily and Cookie share a special moment together.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./14-cookie-waves-goodbye.jpg" /></p>

Then Emily got on the train and Cookie waved goodbye.

The End.

<div class="commentbody">Hey there.  I’m a digital artist, I RmX pictures and also create AVS presets.  If you don’t know, AVS presets are cool little animations synchronized to music that you play in Winamp, an mp3 player.  They are created by mathematical coding and pre-defined effects that are layed out into lists and respond to music or sound.  It is really neat.  I mentioned that I also RmX (remix) pictures.  That means I make them in better quality, brighten them up, or the fun stuff - make them TOTALLY FREAKISHLY WEIRD.  I was just looking around for something like that to do, and I found this site.  I saw the “normal” and “not so normal” pictures and thought:  “This could be a chance to make another picture - “paranormal!”  So, will you let me remix your picture?  I promise it will be pretty weird, but pretty cool too. :)</div>
