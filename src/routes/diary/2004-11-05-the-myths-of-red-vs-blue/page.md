title: The myths of Red vs. Blue

Sean Hannity on the Fox “News” Channel recently held up a map of the United States showing all the red and blue states. He said something to the effect of “Look at all that red!” Clearly an attempt to show that the vast majority of Americans support President Bush.

Bush and Cheney have done some similar day-after analysis of the election results, claiming that the American voters have handed them a clear mandate. This is far from the case. Bush touts the fact that he received the most votes of any presidential candidate in history. This is true, but he doesn’t tell you who received the 2nd most votes in history: John Kerry. In other words, Bush received more votes <b>against</b> him than any winning incumbent candidate in history. The American populace is clearly divided in half over George W. Bush and his policies. There is no simple mainstream. There are two streams, of about equal size, with opposing currents. (Obviously, that’s a vast oversimplification, but American political discourse is rife with oversimplification. Cut me some slack.)

This brings us back to the Red state versus Blue state phenomenon. The GOP media is basically using desert as a political tool. I’m not belittling the states that went for Bush; I’m just saying they are for the most part much larger geographically than many of the states that went for Kerry, and they have much lower population density. But their geographic size makes for an impressive amount of red on the map.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./redstates.gif" /></p>
This is a perfect tool for pundits like Sean Hannity. “Look at all that red!” Yes, there’s a lot of red, but it’s very misleading. So I decided to make my own map.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./redvsblue.gif" /></p>

Using final vote percentages from <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/">electoral-vote.com</a>, I made a map showing the percentage of “red” voters in each state along with the percentage of “blue” voters. The color on top of each state shows the party that won that state’s electoral votes. (Note: this is not perfectly scientific, as my approximations were made by eye, but I tried to be as accurate as possible for the purpose of this exercise.)

Here we see a slightly better representation of the feelings of the American populace. <b>Those red states have a lot of blue in them.</b> The reverse also holds true for the blue states, with the notable exception of Washington, D.C., where an overwhelming 90% of citizens voted for Kerry. D.C. is only 6 pixels high on this map, but to be fair I gave the bottom row to red.

The District of Columbia makes for an interesting example of another failing of the conventional red state-blue state map, as well as of this map: voters from different states are not equally represented. For example, the little bit of blue in D.C. represents nearly 20,000 more voters than the large swath of red in Wyoming. Similarly, the blue in New York State represents more voters than all the red in Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico <b>combined</b>. (These numbers come from <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/electionresults/">Yahoo’s election results page</a>.)

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./comparison.gif" /></p>

To be very clear, I am <b>not saying</b> that New York’s blue voters are more important (or smarter, or better, or richer, or anything) than all the red voters in Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. I’m simply saying that there are <b>more</b> of them, and that the maps do not accurately reflect this.

So please don’t be fooled by all the red on that map that Hannity and others are waving around. Mr. President, please don’t ignore all the blue staters in those red states. And don’t make us start putting stars on our bellies.

<div class="commentbody">Insightful map, although think of who Hannity is pandering to, the right wing. Plus, most people that watch those shows are more educated and understand how each state is won by a majority giving it’s color to it’s respective majority vote. I think Hannity’s underlying message is that because of the vastness of red those states were and are pivotal to winning an election. His point is that the Democratic party failed to penetrate these states and had they been able to they could have won the election. That being said, once the Democratic Party reinvents or adjust its ideals and platform closer to the southern and midwestern and western states, they will make an incredible run for the presidency in 2008. These states will not change their ideals, I know I have lived in nearly all of them, they have a child’s innate sense of moral character, strength, and leadership abilities that the Democratic Party has forgotten.</div>

<div class="commentbody">To the above anonymous poster: You say that Hannity’s point is that “the Democratic party failed to penetrate these states”. I think this map shows that the Democrats have support between 40% and 50% in just about every red state. Even Texas was a 60-40 split. The geographical divide is a myth! There are a LOT of blue staters in EVERY state.</div>

<div class="commentbody">funny to see that i’m not the only person CAPABLE OF THINKING. someone in my classes remarked “there was a lot of red on the map” in reference to the election. and i said, yes, there was a lot of red, but the blue states are representative of the same NUMBER of voters as all of those in the red! those visualizations sure are misleading to the non-thinkers out there.</div>

<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the considerable effort it must have take to construct your map. It helps dispel the Hannity’s attempt to spin that Bush’s 3% margin of victory in popular vote gives him a vast reservoir of “political capital”. In fact to find a closer popular vote winning margin, you gotta’ go way back to Carter’s in ‘76. A landslide is in the order of the 18% winning margin which Reagan got for his second term. Reagan was a uniter, and Bush is no Ronald Reagan.

Barely cracking 51% of the popular vote is nothing exceptional either. Clinton got 50% for his second term despite Perot’s skimming 8% off the top. It would be utter folly for Democrats to abandon their moderate policies and loyal constituencies to chase after evangelicals who fervently believe that the worst problems facing this country are abortion, gay marriages, stem-cell research, and lazy unemployed people. The only significant shift to Bush was a higher proportion of Hispanics, yet most of them still voted for Kerry despite their Church leaders statements that he should not take Communion. Hispanics will increasingly give Democrats brighter prospects as their % of population grows, particularly in Southwest states. Evangelical Christians and the deep South are perfectly sensible to stick like glue with their Republican party. However, the rest of the country will certainly turn deep Blue if the economy and the war in Iraq have not “made progess” by 2008 because the tragedy of 9/11 will not be the huge factor which propelled the Republicans over the line this time.</div>

<div class="commentbody">it is the appropriate way to display the information since the “popular map” is based on population density, 3 people per sq mile vs 30,000 people per sq mile.  Your map is much fairer representation of the votes per capita, rather than by geography.  Thank you for doing the proper schematic, and it should be forwarded to CNN and Fox news.  Many thanks.</div>

<div class="commentbody">Eddie- the map you showed is not a lie, per se. But just like the two maps shown in my discussion above, it doesn’t provide any information or visual representation about one very important fact: population density. All the red counties make it look like there are a lot more Bush voters than Kerry voters than there really are. Breaking it down by county makes it appear more accurate than the regular red state map, but it’s not much different.

A similar but more informative set of maps can be found on the New York Times website. They have an amazing information design group.

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/khtml/2004/11/03/politics/20041103_px_ELECT_GRAPHIC.html">http://www.nytimes.com/packages/khtml/2004/11/03/politics/20041103_px_ELECT_GRAPHIC.html</a>

The maps shown there are a lot more accurate than mine, and they provide a lot more visual information as to who voted for whom and where. Contrast their map showing popular vote by county (similar to the map you pointed out) with their map for popular vote by population.

However, their maps are a little too nuanced, and don’t provide a sufficiently clear and immediate contrast to the conventional red state map, which hides population density (or lack thereof) by filling in large areas with solid red. I like how my map uses this convention against itself, by filling in proportionately large areas of the map with solid blue as well, effectively removing population density from the equation, at least for a given state. Obviously I can’t relocate some of New York’s blue voters out into the red states in the West, which is why I provided the comparison graphic in the second part of the article.</div>

<div class="commentbody">i think it’s funny that the most intelligent, the most cultured, the biggest economy boomers, and the most populated cities in america all went blue. what does that tell us?

and how is it that the most backwoods, the poorest, the least intelligent, the most brainwashed places all went red? what does that tell us? that the poor, stupid, ignorant apes are the majority? that they are uneducated?

come on usa. wise up!

bush took your vote because you have shit for brains. and you’re poor. and you have clotted arteries. and you can barely stand up without having to think really hard about it. and you still don’t know how to read or write or do long division.

a true democracy needs informed educated voters. that is the case here in america no longer.

what’s going to happen?

<div class="commentbody">I feel compelled to point out that democracy in the United States was founded with a largely illiterate, uneducated populace. (There was much discussion about whether the uneducated could properly participate in a democracy, which is why the founding fathers inserted some controls into the system, such as the Electoral College.)

There have been some charts showing a correlation between IQ and voter preference in the 2000 and 2004 elections, but the IQ numbers used are questionable. I don’t think you can draw a hard line relationship between dumb people voting for Bush and smart people voting for Kerry. It’s convenient, but it’s untrue. The Bush administration, and certain media outlets, indulge in plenty of convenient untruths; that is, they are LYING. I don’t think we should mimic that behavior. Fight fire with water, and lies with truth.

Americans may not all be geniuses, but I think they have a pretty strong command of common sense, this re-election notwithstanding. And I think eventually common sense will rule the day. I think a lot of people still don’t know the facts (<a href="http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/Pres_Election_04/html/new_10_21_04.html),">http://www.pipa.org/OnlineReports/Pres_Election_04/html/new_10_21_04.html),</a> but eventually the truth of Bush’s administration will be told. It will take some time, and we may have to throw a lot of eggs, but it will happen.</div>

But he is wrong.

1. The media was in the tank for Kerry, ALL of the slant, inuendo, and subliminal content was aimed at helping Kerry.

2. The economy was NOT driven into the ground, the Dow is up about 300 points since the election. Bush did not send jobs overseas, YOU did that when you made Wal\*Mart No. 1. Look in your computer, EVERY board was made in China… Long before Bush became president.

3. Gasoline prices are artificially low in this country compared to other places. If you complain about Environment, off shore drilling, and drilling in Alaska, then you cannot also complain about Gas Prices.

4. Health Care costs are rising: More people are using more health care, and practitioners must now practice defensive medicine, ordering more and more tests, x-rays, and MRIs to protect themselves in case of lawsuits. Pharmasutical recearch is very expensive, and even now Vioxx was removed from the market. That is a loss of 30 years of research and testing, AND the lawyers are lining up with all sorts of lawsuits. THAT is your “Medical Expense”. And do not point to Canada, their system is in shambles in different ways. You want Government Medicine, GASH… That will be a disaster for everybody.

5. The minimum wage is a joke, and it should be higher, but _real_ peoeple do not and cannot work for less than $10/hr, most will not look at a job for less than $15-20/hour, and the Minimum Wage isn’t going there. Bush was correct when he said that education is the key to a good wage.

6. Yes, a draft bill was proposed. It was proposed by DEMOCRATS, and was voted down. There will be no draft. We need a professional military, not a bunch of kids doing some time.

Finally, it is a great map that you made. Yes I (we) _knew_ that there were close races in every state, and yes we know that this is not a geographic only situation. A map distorted to population densities would be interesting to look at, but then even more telling is a map that shows the county by county vote. Looking at that map, there ARE NO BLUE STATES, only some Blue Cities. Yet cities are the crown jeweles of our country and the seat of civilization.

<div class="commentbody">I guess you can call me one of those Conservative Evengelical Christian Republicans.  I wouldn’t have shown up on this website, except an aquaintance pointed it out to me.

A teacher, one of the wisest men that I’ve ever met, and blessed with great thinking capability, taught a select few of us back as early as the mid 1970’s that this country has gone over the cliff edge, and is plunging towards its own destruction.

Our children are illiterate, common sense has ceased to exist, the mores, ethics and values that guided this country to where we stood at our pinnacle of the 1940s and 1950s has evaporated. We no longer support our country, or its leadership. The last great Democratic President said ‘Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.’ That sentiment has been lost in both parties, and now all we have is derision and destruction. Indeed, within our own country, we have sown the seeds of our own downfall. Drugs, lack of social responsibility, the laize-faire attitude that has so permeated the Democratic party, the ‘bread and circus’ that started innocently enough as the ‘New Deal’ and has morphed and mutated into social welfare for those people who are too damned lazy to get off their asses to go find work. All of this, and much more, is leading to the downfall of the United States of America.

And no, the Republican party isn’t blameless. Far from it. The concept of making money for oneself, and making so much of it that it takes away from others, to be ‘sucessful’ to the point of destroying peoples lives by taking their jobs, and selling them overseas, is not a way to win friends and influence ‘the people.’

Furthermore, have we become some insensitized to our own plight that we refuse to do anything about it? Approximately 115 million people voted, but yet, there should be close to another 100 million who didn’t vote, but are of age and eligible to vote. Take out 10 million for those in hospitals, nursing homes, or mentally incapable of voting, and where are the other 80-90 million people of this country?

Every day, I see more and more proof that this country has gone over the edge. I see the next American Revolution coming, and a lot faster than people will believe. It will be upon us, and if you think it’s bad now, wait until then!

There are those, and I would suggest most people who read this will be among them, who will disagree with me. They believe that what they do will prevent what is happening, but in actuality, their desire to ‘help’ people will infact, only speed up the eventual fate of this country. Your sincerity is and was never in doubt, and your desire to be a good person is well understood, but your methods, in conjunction with actions by the Republicans, both together have driven us off the road, and we now can only wait for the inevitable crash on the rocks below.</div>

<div class="commentbody">As an addendum to the post I made yesterday, I am severely concerned over a piece of news I read today.  The story of Andrew Veal’s apparent election-day related suicide at Ground Zero in New York must ring out as a warning klaxon that we are too divided, too far on either side from a centric point of view.

As each side moves farther from the center and farther from each other, they tend to pull people with them. I was going to say ‘they tend to pull the electorate…’, but the electorate _are_ people, you, me, our neighbors, real people that we know and love.

Mr. Veal’s actions are demonstrative of the truly serious splitting of the United States of America. Of course, it also demonstrates that Mr. Veal had some serious mental issues that were not addressed, and I’m sure his friends, family and co-workers will, in hindsight, remember that they _had_ seen the warning signs, only not believed them to be possible.

But, more importantly, Mr. Veal has set precedent for other violent acts to be committed in the name of this election. Is it possible that some disgruntled Democrat would hunt down and kill the newly elected Senator from Iowa, the man who replaced Sen. Daschle? Could some Republican friend lose his temper after too much taunting from a Democratic friend and co-worker and inflict physical damage or death upon them?

Wake up, America! Reconcile your differences, work hand in hand with one another to create a place that our forefathers imagined this country would be. Do not, by your polarization on issues, tear this country down faster than what it already is going!</div>

<div class="commentbody">Hello, to whom it may concern. Two questions: First, where exactly does the “dumb” line begin between the North and the South? Where do you smart commenters live anyway? Second, if the Democrats are so smart, why do they use James Carville as a spokesperson? This guy is not “smart” in anyones mind that I know of “Repuplican. or Democratic.” Have you heard this guy chew up the English Language. My 3rd grader uses better English…</div>

<div class="commentbody">Nick- I’m from Alabama, and I’m very smart. Incredibly smart. You would not BELIEVE how smart I am. Okay, seriously though, I don’t think there is a ‘dumb line’ between North and South. If any of the above commentators implied that there is, they are mistaken.

However, it has occurred to me to look into the obvious disparity between voter preference in heavily populated urban precincts, which largely went for Kerry, and sparsely populated rural precincts, which largely went for Bush. Here’s a map which visualizes this fact:

<a href="http://www.esri.com/industries/elections/graphics/results2004_lg.jpg">http://www.esri.com/industries/elections/graphics/results2004_lg.jpg</a>

The North does have a higher occurrence of these large population areas, but they exist in the South and West as well.

Also, I think it’s important to make a distinction between intelligence and ignorance. There are many intelligent voters who voted for Bush. But I maintain that Bush voters were and are ignorant of some basic facts about the major issues of his adminstration, and those who know the facts voted for Kerry. Many people will take offense at this position, but I think it’s true. Have a look:

Bush Supporters Still Believe Iraq Had WMD or Major Program, Supported al Qaeda

As for James Carville, I think he’s funny. He’s Cajun, so maybe that’s why he sounds like he’s abusing the English language to you. I dunno. He seems like a pretty smart guy to me.</div>

<div class="commentbody">This technique of map distortion by using geographical area has been previous described in the book:

“How to Lie with Maps” by Mark Monmonier, (published before GWB ever got into office.)

See <a href="http://www.markmonmonier.com/">http://www.markmonmonier.com/</a>

It is (or maybe it is not) remarkable that the US has been hoodwinked once again into thinking that a closely and bitterly contested election was a mandate based on shoddy thinking.

It’s also remarkable how unanalytical the press is on this subject. Hook, line, and sinker…

Karl Rove thinks that this election means decades of GOP rule. I’m afraid as long as they rule by Fear and Ignorance, there will be no immediate end to this nightmare…</div>

<div class="commentbody">Take a look at the county by county breakdown, and you’ll see that out of over 3000 counties, Kerry only carried something like 200-300 of them.  These are dominated by a couple of dozen large cities.

And, it is simply inaccurate to try to claim that the big Kerry majorities came in areas populated by people of greater intelligence. Research has consistently shown that Republicans have a higher median level of education than Democrats. Intelligence and educational level are not synonymous. However, there is a very good correlation, and accurate IQ based data are very hard to come by.</div>

<div class="commentbody">Steve- I created the map that is the centerpiece of this article in order to do ONE thing: to dispel the myth that red states are ALL red. I wanted to point out that there are blue staters in EVERY state. It’s true that Kerry’s support is for the most part localized in large population centers, but to be honest I didn’t want to confuse the message of my map by trying to represent that information as well. There are plenty of maps that do this (some of them are linked in the comments above), but I don’t think any of them provide as clear a contrast to the convential red-blue map as mine does.

That said, there IS clearly a geographical divide between Bush and Kerry voters, but it is not a South and West vs. Northeast and West Coast divide, as the conventional red-blue map leads many people to believe. It is a divide between urban populations and rural ones. I’ve been mulling over a piece about this, but I’m not quite sure how to tackle it. I think it’s a tricky situation, for both sides. The Dems needs to reach out to rural and suburban voters, and Bush needs to develop stronger support in urban centers. (When I say urban centers, I’m not talking exclusively about ghettos, which many people take that term to mean. I’m talking about large population centers, e.g. big cities.) I think perhaps it may be a problem that will require more historical perspective than I can provide.

As to the claim that people of higher intelligence are more likely to be Kerry supporters, I did not make that claim. I don’t doubt that there is likely a pretty even distribution of intelligence among the supporters of both candidates. I did, however, cite a study that suggests that many people who support Bush were unaware of certain facts, and that if they knew the truth of those facts, they would likely not be Bush supporters. (The PIPA study linked above.)</div>

<div class="commentbody">I don’t think these maps are relevant. Bush won. It wasn’t a landslide, but it wasn’t like 2000 either. Florida in 2000 was won by a little over 500 votes. Ohio in 2004 was won by over 100,000 votes. The popular vote was won by over 3 and a half million, not half a million as in 2000. The majority in the house and the senate was increased for the republicans, as well as a slight increase in governors. All these things are not chance. And please don’t try to claim the media is backing Bush, when everyone knows the media has supported democrats forever. If you don’t believe that, you are truly in denial. The only reason I can think of to vote democrat is if you are a democrat in office and you want to remain there. Think of what Kerry said during his campaign. “I would have done things differently.” Okay fine, but he never said what he would have done, only that it would have been different. That’s what you want to vote for?</div>

<div class="commentbody">Proud vet- These maps aren’t about whether Bush won or not. I’m not disputing that.

The maps ARE relevant to those who feel that the media and the administration are distorting the results in order to convince Americans that Bush has been handed a mandate. Certainly large gains in both houses help to provide the impression of a mandate, but the fact is that there are LOTS of people who don’t support Bush’s policies, and the conventional map hides this fact and makes it look like the vast majority of the country supports Bush.

Kerry’s loss can be blamed on a number of things, some of which are his own fault, some of which are not. But these maps are not about that.

As for the media having ‘supported Democrats forever’, I think this is a myth. It is unfortunately a self-fulfilling myth, as most members of the media are so afraid of being called liberal that they’re afraid to report on the President’s mistakes. Certainly there are some media outlets that are left-leaning, such as The Nation and Air America Radio but they are not big media players. CNN and the other majors are centrist at best, but Fox News is clearly well to the right on the political spectrum. If you don’t think so, you should watch OutFoxed, or listen to all this talk of a ‘mandate’ which simply doesn’t exist.</div>

<div class="commentbody">Look kids, it’s okay. All of this will come out in the wash IF we’re so damned lucky to get the bleach amount right…

This election, be it red, blue, colorfast or grey, is not about who “won” or “lost”, it is about gullibility; ours.

The American People.

We are the administrators to our government, yet we allow the secret agenda to blind us, as long as we get the dessert we want, the latte we like most, the cell phone with no raoming charges and the SUV that rides the smoothest…

As long as we get what comforts us most we can allow our basic rights to be whitewashed.

How can a true Republic allow a private-for-profit corporation to run our elections? Diebold refuses to allow us our true voice, the voice that actaully dictates what we truly want in the only way our constitution still allows us to, with our votes.

Do the math. The last two elections are the first two elections of the “digital age” and we are all fooked by the facts. Congress refused to pass a bill introduced over two years ago, then reintroduced three more times, that would demand a paper trail of audit-able results be made with US e-voting machines. Hell, even Venezuala has that capacity, yet our Republican controlled congress stood firm in the fight to not allow the bill to pass.

That’s one.

Thousands of calls are coming in now that report how screwed up this election really is. One small precinct in one small county in Ohio, a state where Bush led by a mere 133,000 votes to gain the electoral college and “win” the election, granted him over 4,000 votes, from a precinct that only had 643 voters. Amazing.

That’s two.

Count up the remaining anomilies that are still flooding in, the mainstream news picking it up finally, and we will be surprised if a court injunction is not made before December 12th? Hmmm. Meanwhile, Bush is installing some of the craziest replacements for Ahscroft, Evans, Powell, et al.

That’s almost three and we’re nearly out. We The People are, at this moment, no longer a factor in this country. Unless we get up and slam the door now, we will continue to sell out to this administration.

Time for the gut check. Do we really have what it takes to find the truth? Or, will we continue to buy the big lie?

<div class="commentbody">We did not elect a president of the United States last Tuesday. Instead

the people of the South and the Midwest voted for the second president

of the confederacy. I live in a state of the Union that did not secede in 1860.

One aspect that did change, now the rebels have moved to the Republican

Party. The rebels don’t like any of the New Deal that Franklin Delano Roosevelt

enacted nor do they like the great Society of Lyndon Johnson. It appears to me

that these rebels don’t even like that Lincoln freed blacks in 1865. These

rebels don’t like government much. They appear the compatriots of David Duke

and Timothy McVeigh. They use god to proclaim their morality but in fact

their morality reflects that of a class of immoral people that god would condemn.

These rebel republicans fail the test of morality with the following questions.

Does it appear moral to

1. ignore pepople who lost jobs?

2. Refuse to extend unemployment benefits of those who still seek

   a job after 6 months but Republicans in congress refuse to extend said benefits?

3. Pass a fake prescription drug benefit which gives people a meager 20 percent

   discount that does no better than a private discount card that existed in the

   1990’s that industry created to save face?

4. Take away overtime pay by the labor department ruling for millions

   of people?

5. To lie about going to war in Iraq with 1,000 soldiers dying and 7,000 or more

   soldiers getting injured?

6. Propose a money siphoning scheme for social security for new private accounts

   which will use the stock market. The removal of the FICA income tax cap

   will fund social security better than introducing money draining accounts

   that republicans hope will destroy the system.

7. Refuse to increase the minimum wage so people working hard can keep

   up with inflation that has reduced the buying power of the minimum wage.

Republicans focus on the wrong sets of morality in my view and these southern

and midwestern rebels make up their constituency. They appear the immoral

people on the whole and not Democrats who really care about people who need

help.

Well for now the South has risen again and George W Bush has gotten

elected as the 2nd confederate president.

<div class="commentbody">Some other Pascal- yes, i readily admit that my maps do not accurately represent the geographical location of blue voters. I readily admit that they reside largely in high density population areas, i.e. big cities.

But the conventional results map tells a lie by making it look like a state is entirely populated with red voters. My map uses that same lie, against itself, by showing that each state is approximately half blue voters as well.

I wanted to change one variable in the ‘rules’ of making the map, to make a simple, clear, and undeniable argument: The red states have a lot of blue voters in them.

Certainly there is more of the story to be told, and there are many ways to tell it. If you want a map that tells more of the story, there are plenty linked in these comments. Or you can make your own.</div>

<div class="commentbody">Regarding why the larger metro areas voted for Kerry while so much of the rest of the country seemingly voted for Shrub, check out this article:  www.consortiumnews.com/2004/111004.html    His suggestion is that those areas (smaller and/or remote) don’t have access to as many choices of media as people in larger cities do. The little places are held captive by the right-wing media giants and so are brainwashed (my word, not his) day after day after day.  Consider this: a child of abusive parents or the wife of an abusive husband. They’re told many times every day how useless and stupid they are and they’ll never amount to anything.  If they hear it long enough, eventually they may believe it.  So it is with the right-wing media: they repeat their lies over and over and over until gullible little minds have no choice but to succumb.  For more interesting right-wing twists, check out www.moveon.org and the complaint they filed against Fox News for their ‘fair & balanced’ advertising slogan. They include stats showing the majority of Fox news’ stories are slanted way to the right; and that of the people who still believe in the WMD stories and other Shrub falsehoods, most of those get their ‘news’ exclusively from Fox.   To see how the brainwashing has worked over the last 20 years, look at www.rockridgeinstitute.org and search for Framing.  It is mind-boggling how evil men can be, and how gullible we have become.  Perhaps “Ignorance is bliss” should be the new motto for a lot of the people who voted for Shrub.

Another thing we keep hearing is that voters were concerned with “moral values”; however, no one mentions how many of those “values” voters were Kerry voters.

It’s all a bunch of sound and fury, signifying bla bla bla bla bla</div>

<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the link to the Democrat’s beliefs.

#4 S.S. How can you protect something by keeping it in it’s current form, when it’s current form is not going to survive. S.S. will not continue as is, let’s do something about it. I haven’t seen anything the Dems propose that will help. The “deficits” and who creatied them can be twisted so many ways that we should stop using that as an argumement.

#5 A “fair” judiciary is only a point of view held by the individual. I would prefer to have a judiciary that rules on the constitution, not “their” interpretaion of it. But we can only judge from our view point.

#6 Our environment is also affected by every other country in the free world. Until we convince the rest of the world to be conservationists, how can we expect to control this? When I see Dems leaving the large cities (your theories tell us that’s where they live) and their large consumption of energy I will agree with them.

Maybe when every Dem is driving a hybrid car, living with oil lamps and wood burning stoves, I will believe their love of the environment is true.

#1 Government cannot create jobs and keep them in the country. Only Business can do that. And when Business is taxed to the max it will look for other ways to do business. I think Government has shown it’s “Business” doesn’t work. Their Business is to give themselves raises counter to the nation’s averages and doesn’t allow for performance based review. (oh wait, that’s what elections are for)

#2 Health Care is another one of those Business deals. You can’t force someone to provide a product and then tell them how much they should be paid for it. The more reasons we give health professionals to avoid going into practice (high insurance costs, threat of lawsuits, lack of incentives) the more they will choose to not go into practice.

#3 War. OK, we know you don’t want war. I am not arguing the reasons we are at war, everyone will believe the righteousness of it based on their point of view. That being said, How do you make another nation a democracy? Diplomacy: how diplomatic is a Dictator? Do you really think he is going to be swayed by diplomacy? Have you ever gotten a bully to stop being a bully by being diplomatic? No, you get your dad to show him force or you stand up to him. Terrorists do not change their ways based on the other side being diplomatic.

A person from one of those red states who voted for Pres Bush. I don’t expect you to understand or agree. What I would like is for America to stop being a brat and stop throwing a fit because some of them didn’t get their way. As to the 8 years of Clinton: I didn’t enjoy it, I didn’t want it, but I continued being an American and working in my communitiy to make it better. Why can’t we all start there? </div>

This is incorrect; in 1992, there were approximately 59.5 million votes against Bill Clinton (i.e. votes for George H.W.

Similarly, some other people have claimed (not necessarily on this site) that more people voted against George W. Bush than against any other incumbent president. In fact, there were more votes against George H.W. Bush in 1992 (over 65 million votes for Clinton, Perot and minor party candidates).</div>

<div class="commentbody">First, let me preface my post by stating that I am definitely not pro-Bush or pro-Republican. Neither am I pro-Kerry or pro-Democrat. That said…

Most of you are missing the point. Yes, Kerry won a lot of votes via a small # of states and small geographical area.

The Electoral College system is not perfect, but it’s better than a straight popular vote nationwide.

Why?

Because if we had that, campaigns would ONLY cater to heavily populated cities and states. Do you think our country would be better off with only that element (effectively) electing the president?

Ask Northern Californians how they feel about Southern California ruling their state politics.

The fact of the matter is that the president is elected by, and I say should be elected by, a wide range of the citizenry. This means not disenfranchising those who happen to live in rural areas or low population states.

Like it or not, the United States means all 50 states, and this means that the wide variety of Americans lives all over the place.</div>

My point stands that by simplifying the opposition viewpoint in order to simplify the process of discrediting it, you fail to truly understand the opposition and you fail to garner sympathy for your own position.

Bao- I didn’t create this map as an argument for or against the electoral college. I created it to show that there are a large number of blue voters in every state, and that Bush’s ‘mandate’ is predicated on false pretenses. The electoral college system has clearly shown some flaws in the past two elections, but you are right that simply discarding it is not a perfect solution either.</div>

Indirectly, any of this map “revision” is

a veiled attack on the electoral college

system. The general theme is “But but but…

look…not everyone in a red state voted

Republican!” Well, of course not. Duh. The

electoral college system, with a couple

rather inconsequential exceptions (NE & ME),

has its primary purpose being to award ALL

electoral votes to the majority winner of

each state. Even if they win by just one

vote. So, when anyone complains about this

or tries to point out that the straight

red/blue state-by-state map is unfair or

whatever, it _is_ an attack on the electoral

college system.

Educated people should realize that the map

that shows each state an entire color is a

map of the _electoral college_ system. And

any support of its usage is just because that

is how we elect the president. The mandate

_is_ there because the majority of the \*wide

variety\* of citizens, defined as those who

live _throughout_ this vast country, chose

Bush. ( – I did not!)

Sure, there are many types of people who in

live in large cities. But in a large city,

most are more similar to each other than,

say, a rural person from Alabama and a rural

person from Montana. Geography _does_ play

an important role in distinguishing people

from one another.

People who live in large cities tend to vote

Democrat. And they tend to vote that way for

similar reasons. This makes them more of a

homogenous population, even though they may

be Jamaican, black, have German ancestry,

etc. They live in the same VERY SMALL area

that is their city and in the same political

and economic environement (though they may

not be economically similar, of course, etc.)

Now, look at the rest of the country, the

part that does not live in large metro areas.

They occupy the vast majority of the area of

the country, but they are spread further

apart. (Duh!) They are not nearly as

homogenous a population.

My point is that _it is good_ that these

people are, perhaps, better represented than

people in densely populated areas. I

believe in this because even though I do not

like W. Bush, I respect that a wide variety

of Americans do for some reason.

Think of an extreme example: 300M total in

the country, but let’s say that half live in

California. (Just an example), while the

remaining half live in the other 49 states.

And then imagine that 99% of Californians

voted Kerry. Without the electoral college

perhaps being unfair to California by not

being heavily based on a straight popular

vote, the country is truly represented better

if the other 49 states support Bush, even if

he only wins by a single vote in each of

those 49 states.

If Bush wins the majority, however small,

in 49 states, he deserves to be president

even if he doesn’t get a single vote in one

state that has half the country’s population.

The other 49 states are more representative

of the country than a single state that

loves Kerry.

Heck, in my example, Kerry would even have

a huge victory in the popular vote, but

would lose by a landslide in electoral votes.

And that’s they way it should be.</div>

Your comparison between Alabama and montana works just as well for a comparison between New York and LA. An urban environment is a TYPE OF PLACE, and just like the rural environment is not THE SAME PLACE, as you seem to think (or at least wrote).

Besides, geographic dispersion does not equal diversity. (My crap smells just as bad in montana as it does in new york, despite the vastly different locations - being in a different place does not inherenltly make it different).

“And then imagine that 99% of Californians

if the other 49 states support Bush, even if

Simply saying something doesn’t make it true, or even a good argument. If the election going to bush, even when the popular vote went to Kerry, and you call that “More Representative,” then you must have some wacky definition of “representative” that I really dont understand.

This system is based on a federal collection of semi independent states, where each state gets to cast a semi-proportional vote for president. But I believe _people_ should have a voice in the presedential election, not states. Just seems more fair to me, as if this country were actually made up of people, not arbitrary political entities we call states.

<div class="commentbody">Your map is very interesting and even as life-long Republican I appreciate the purpose of the map.  I think it really points out the depth of the “great divide” in our country which unfortunately seems to be growing rather than shrinking.  This divide will not close because our differences are too significant.  The ideals of Republicans (and vice versa) will never be understood by Democrats because they perceive life from a different worldview.

There have been several posts on this page that have either hinted at a lack of intelligence in the red states or blatantly stated such. Do you know of any studies that have been done to show the level of education of voters in urban areas as to voters in suburban and/or rural areas? I would be interested in seeing this type of information because I believe that it is fallacy to believe that “red” voters are less intelligent than “blue” voters. In fact, with the hold the Democratic Party has on labor unions, I would suggest that the lack of intelligence most certainly leans toward the “blue” voters in the highly populated areas.

Love and peace to all true American patriots and to the heroes who fought and are fighting to keep America great!</div>

<div class="commentbody">By the way, I’m 35 years old and during my short life I’ve only seen 2 presidents elected from the Democrat Party.  However, there have been five Republican presidents who have served during my lifetime.  Now I realize the education I received at my mid-western university may not compare to the education some receive at an Ivy League school, but I’m pretty sure that I can decipher major tendancies and political leanings when I see them.</div>

<div class="commentbody">CoChris- I doubt seriously there is any solid correlation between intelligence and voter preference. Anyone who has implied here or elsewhere that such a correlation exists is mistaken.

Regarding your second comment: true, their have been 5 Republican Presidential terms and only 2 Democratic ones in that time period, but we are really only talking about 5 people here: Carter, Reagan, GHW Bush, Clinton, and GW Bush. 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats. That is not a large enough sample to draw out any real trend information. All of these elections (save Reagan and Clinton’s re-elections) have been really close. So if you’re implying this country is trending Republican, this data is not enough to prove your case.</div>

<div class="commentbody">I don’t know about the correlation between intellegence and voter preference, but definatlly between voter preference and EDUCATION.  Intelligence, like a concept, is worthless unless honed and harnessed.</div>

<div class="commentbody">@ Understanding Education-

I assume you are refering to one of those sites that shows the “blue” states having more college graduates ect… Sorry, but that does not show that there is a corelation between education and voting choice. Why? because most of the states had a lot of people voting for “both” candidates. You don’t know which “half” of each state’s voters had more college grads.

For example, the people who voted for Bush in California ( a blue state) might have had more college grads then the people who voted Kerry (or vice versa). You could say the same thing about a red state….In Ohio, there might have been more college grads who voted for Kerry. </div>

<div class="commentbody">I disagree with you in regards to everything, were do you get off calling OUR Fallen Soldiers Losers and that they died in Vain.  My Brother-In-Law was a Marine and Proud of It..He passed away in Provence, Iraq.  He was a good Marine Soldier, Husband, Father, Son, Brother, Uncle and a Friend. Thanks to All the Fallen, you get to kiss & Hug your kids at night….They dont get to do that, so for you to say that Our Fallen including 1st LT. OSCAR JIMENEZ died in vain and that their Losers is WRONG & DISRESPECTFUL to their Families.  But you know, well maybe you dont but let me tell you that was their choice, TO JOIN THE MILITARY SERVICE AND SERVE AND PROTECT THEIR COUNTRY, So their family’s and OURS TOO, can be safe from all threath.  So were do you get the loser and Vain from….You are here, you were NEVER under Hostile Fire like 1st LT. OSCAR JIMENEZ, He saves lives that day-did you know that.  Maybe you didnt know because your head is way up your #@%…. Lourdes P.</div>

<div class="commentbody">I voted democrat and I am still proud of it, you can say all you please about the republicans.  My proof is that I had a good working years when a democrat such as Clinton was in office, and now a republican I am holding down 2 jobs to make ends meet.  I hope when this helps to prove who is for the working class and not the rich, give me a tax break, republicans.

I can’t wait until I have the opportunity to vote for a democrat again. Mabey I will get lucky and have a good year then.

see ya</div> -->
