<div class="commentbody">F— you Raba-

Going by your name, I can’t tell what sex you are- you freak. Raba?

You probably renamed yourself that because none of your friends cared enough to give you a nickname of your own. When I get a break from my hectic schedule I’m gonna come hunt you down–so be looking over your shoulder-

One day I’ll be there; and I’ll pick you up out of the puddle of urine you’ve been sleeping in, and stomp your face right back down into the blood and piss soiled earth.

jus’ kiddin’</div> -->
