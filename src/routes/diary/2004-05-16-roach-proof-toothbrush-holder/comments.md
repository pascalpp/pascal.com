<div class="commentbody">The whole world is scared of germs. When I bought my last toothbrush at the regular drug store, it came with one of these:

Cool, because there are germs everywhere, and it’s portable.

When I was having roach nightmares, my mommy said she’d buy me this.

If all else fails, roaches are afraid of Fire Trucks.

I know he anit in iraq, we had to pull that leader out a hol like a rat and what is going on with him. I would hte to be him, no where to go, in jail, eating cheesetos. they say he like those.
