Tonight I saw a tiny little roach on my bathroom floor. I grew up in Alabama, where the 2-inch tree roaches make regular forays into your house and throw parties. So I wasn’t grossed out. I was a little annoyed, but mostly I was reminded of this factoid I once heard about cockroaches, that being that they like to munch on toothbrush bristles. This may just be some sort of old wives’ tale, but nonetheless I found myself looking at the ceramic toothbrush holder, wondering if the little guy on the floor, or one of his buddies, could scale the wall, climb on to the toothbrush holder, and from there ascend to the apex of my toothbrush and start munching. Pretty quickly I decided it would be a piece of cake for a roach to do that, if he or she so desired.

Then my mind set to devising some form of roach-proof toothbrush holder. At first I came up with a glass of water with a socket in the bottom, into which the end of the toothbrush could be inserted. The water would form a sort of moat around the toothbrush, fending off any roach-esque comers. But I thought that might not be completely roach-proof, as an ambitious or persistent roach might be able swim or paddle across the moat and then make his way on to the shaft of the toothbrush and upward to munch. I kept thinking.

It occurred to me that the most elegant solution would be to suspend the toothbrush in the air somehow; if there are no solid materials touching the toothbrush, then there’s nothing for a roach to climb across to reach the toothbrush. But how would you suspend the toothbrush in mid-air?

MAGNETS.

I haven’t completely figured it out yet, but right now I’ll have to sleep on it. If I make any more progress on solving this ridiculously non-problematic problem, I’ll let you know.

<div class="commentbody">The whole world is scared of germs. When I bought my last toothbrush at the regular drug store, it came with one of these:

Cool, because there are germs everywhere, and it’s portable.

When I was having roach nightmares, my mommy said she’d buy me this.

If all else fails, roaches are afraid of Fire Trucks.

<div class="commentbody">OK first you need to find out where those thing are getting in. once thats done you now need to find you some sort of amimal/pet that will attack those nasty creatures. then make sure you don’t on\ver feed the pet so that it is always looking for the roaches and not be overfeed like Garfield the Cat is on lasguna. Not that I blame Garfield cause it is jhons fault because if jhon didn’t have all that food laying around then Garfield would be hungry and kill that mouse and he also wouldn’t be so fat causr all he does is eat,sleep and push around odie. Ever notice that bully’s like Garfield are all wayts fat and the ones they pick on are skinny like odie&lt; I don’t think thats fair. Someone should stand up for the little guy. It’s almost like these small places in the world no one stands up for them when they are pushed around unless they have some thing to offer. If you don’t agree with me {that means yiur a bully} then why are we in iraq oil that’s why shouldn’t we be looking for thsat bin lidden guy. I know he anit in iraq, we had to pull that leader out a hol like a rat and what is going on with him. I would hte to be him, no where to go, in jail, eating cheesetos. they say he like those. I wonder who’s paying for all those bags. then I suppose that I………………………………….

I’m sorry what was the issue we were talking about at first? </div> -->
