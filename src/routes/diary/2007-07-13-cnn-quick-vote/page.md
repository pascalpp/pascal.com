So for some reason I'm a pretty regular reader of CNN.com. It's one of the few sites I actually visit in a browser directly -- everything else I read is via RSS in NetNewsWire. (If you haven't tried RSS, you should.)

As a liberal and regular DailyKos reader, I find that CNN.com gives me a pretty good overview of the issues (or non-issues) that are occupying (or being fed into) the American consciousness at a given moment in time. A lot of it is crap, but that's to be expected. Nonetheless, there is one part of CNN.com that regularly infuriates me: the Quick Vote.

This feature asks a simple question of CNN.com readers, usually with Yes or No responses. What infuriates me most is that it has the potential to be a tremendous feature, but that potential is almost always completely wasted each time a new question is posted. Because the questions they ask are so fucking inane! And worse, they only allow readers to answer Yes or No. There is no room for nuance.

So I've decided to mirror CNN.com's Quick Vote feature here on my blog, with an important third option: "I don't care". Let's begin. Answer honestly!
