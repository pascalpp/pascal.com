<div class="commentbody">If your wit and sense of humor was more similar to mine it would be scarry!  Any chance we’re related?!  I love reading your sailing diary, even if I don’t know you and you have no clue who I am.  Actually that kind of makes it fun!  Let’s see….funny, likes to sail, good looking, writes songs….if you’re not single can we clone you!!!????  Ooooohhh, but if we are related that could be ick!  So, where are you headed to next???  Caribbean?  Maybe I’ll see you there!  Hey, interenet flirting is kind of fun, HA!  Adios!  P.S. I’ve been sailing all day and have had a couple chilly cold ones, hence the forwardness…. hey, it’s all good! Bye for now!</div>

<div class="commentbody">setting… Easter Regatta, Jost Van Dyke, sitting on a friends’ boat playing guitar, drinking some beers and star gazing…is that a slow moving star? a plane? no, it’s a “Satellite” and next thing I know I’m creating a make-shift rendition of a really cool song I heard on the internet…catch myself humming it a lot actually. I’d love to hear more….happy sailing!  p.s. Hatch rocked…bonfire not the same without you and your sis there for entertainment…</div>
