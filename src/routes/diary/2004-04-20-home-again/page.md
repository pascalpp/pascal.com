Now I’m home again, listening to the Kinks.

I feel kinda sad but I don’t really wanna go into it.

I’ll run tomorrow and it will hurt different and that will feel good. Then I’ll go to the Excellent Dumpling House and drown my sorrows in a big ass bowl of cold peanut noodles.

Ah, I feel better already.

<div class="commentbody">hello pascal… I am going to come to NYC and make you feel better. sorry that I haven’t written you back yet (may this suffice, however public it is. I’ll type something privately later). I’m hoping that your workout will prepare you for ‘lugging my gear’ (just kidding, because actually my gear is so very light). LOVE AND RICE CAKES, rosie</div> -->
