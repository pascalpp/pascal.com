I would certainly agree that there is no good reason the primary process should be this long. But the problem lies in how early the primary process starts, not how long it is taking to resolve itself. We've been watching the potential Democratic candidates jockeying for position for over a year now, and that's obviously too long. But I think that is largely an indicator of how eager everyone is, including the traditional corporate media, to see this lame fucking President replaced. And that eagerness is a good thing.

But now it's down to two candidates, Obama and Clinton. (I'm an avowed Obama supporter, but I would vote for Clinton in a heartbeat if she were to win the nomination.) As things are, many are calling for Clinton to throw in the towel. Some are saying that this prolonged primary is bad for the Democratic party, that the in-fighting and division will hurt us in the long run. There are plenty of reasons why Clinton might withdraw, but there are some very good things about this prolonged Democratic primary.

For one, our candidates are getting a good workout. Whoever emerges will be stronger and better able to handle the crap the GOP will throw at them this fall.

For another, our candidates are getting more air time, which is important in winning voters for the general election.

And third, perhaps most importantly, citizens from all the states are seeing that their vote matters for the first time in a long time. Usually the nomination is settled and done with by the time the New Hampshire primary rolls around, or soon after. This time, every state is having a chance to weigh in. As a result, new voters are registering as Democrats in record numbers across the nation. This is terrific for building the power of the party in the run-up to the general election, and for maintaining a healthy party once Obama wins in November.

Yes, that's right, he will!
