Tonight I volunteered for a couple hours at the Women’s Press Collective. We inventoried all the ink and paper stock and made jokes about miniature envelopes for business cards. Yep, they got some.

The WPC is a grassroots volunteer-driven organization which aims to make publishing facilities more readily available to other organizations and individuals who are trying to make the world a little better. They recognize that all progressive movements of the past were forced to develop their own means of getting their message out, and that this is even truer today as our national media gets more and more consolidated and corporate-controlled.

Anyway, it was a good time. They have this awesome old press, a Chief 15. It looks like a one-person tank. Looking forward to learning how to run that thing. I’m heading back on Saturday to help with a magazine distribution and then next Wednesday for who knows what.

<div class="commentbody">if you haven’t already, you may want to research the WPC. althoug i cannot speak with current experience, in the past WPC was a entity of the Provisional Communist Party and was raided by the FBI and NYPD on two locations for plotting against the government and stock-piling weapons. it’s true that WPC could be legit now, but maybe you should ask them about their past. </div>

<div class="commentbody">Get away from this group fast!!! It may seem good on the outside but it is a front for the National Labor Federation.  They are a communist revolutioary  cult.  They net over $1 million a year under the guise of helping the poor or publishinging  information. very little reaches those who it preports to help. Checkout www.rickross.com</div>

<div class="commentbody">Hey. I’ve just met some people from the Women’s Press Collective. I think it’s a great idea but I don’t want to get involved if I’m giving money to a political party. But how can it hurt to volunteer my time? I don’t think I could get brainwashed and I’d only be volunteering once and a while. Thoughts, anyone?</div>

<div class="commentbody">I volunteer for an organization that is on that NATLFED list too, and I’ve been volunteering there for 5 months now. I have had a couple of suspicious encounters, which makes me think that they are a bit of a cult, but as far as I can tell they really are interested in helping people. I am not brainwashed, just more socially aware. I can volunteer in my free time and I feel like I’m contributing to a cause that will someday be strong enough to improve the lives of working class people everywhere.

P.S. Does anyone have the address of Women’s Press Collective? I’d like to check it out sometime. Thanks.</div>

<div class="commentbody">i’m with the Women’s Press Collective right now. Does anyone still have any doubts about their work? I’m only asking this because my friend and  I got recruited at school, and we both have been volunteering there for about 3 months now. But we both kinda feel that they aren’t doing anything for women. We kinda join on the premise to “help low-income families” and all that.

Let me know before I make commitments that I’ll regret later.</div>
