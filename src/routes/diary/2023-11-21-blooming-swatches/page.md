<script lang="ts">
  import SwatchGrid from './SwatchGrid.svelte';
</script>

Had a little CSS dream that told me to make this. Need to hook this up to [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io)!

_Update: I did it. Make sure your volume isn't too loud, and tap or drag over the swatches._

<div class="bleed-right">
  <SwatchGrid />
</div>
