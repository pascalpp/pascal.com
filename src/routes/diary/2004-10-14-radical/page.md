Last night George’s main tactic in the debate seemed to be to paint John Kerry as a liberal, as being “out of the mainstream”. In reality, George is himself an extremist, painting himself as a centrist. He’s a radical in conservative clothing. This guy has liberally squandered a record budget surplus on tax cuts that go overwhelmingly to corporations and to the rich, he’s liberally wasted our soldiers’ lives and limbs in an unnecessary war, and he’s liberally cast the rights of American citizens aside in favor of American corporations who are shipping American jobs overseas and milking American workers and consumers dry. Radical!
