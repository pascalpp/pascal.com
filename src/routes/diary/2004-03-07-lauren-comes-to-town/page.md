My sister Lauren got to town last nite. I guess now she calls herself Bama. She goes to school in Florida. She came with her two friends Matt, who now calls himself Levi, and Liz, who now calls herself Liz.

We went to a party at the <a href="http://www.zagodesign.com">Zago</a> office, my friends’ design firm. Here’s some pics.
