So I’m on <a href="https://www.pascal.com/tour">tour</a> with <a href="http://www.stephanierearick.com/">Stephanie Rearick</a> and <a href="http://www.milkbaby.net">MiLkBabY</a>.

We kicked off the tour at Linneman’s in Milwaukee on Thursday night. Jim Linneman recently renovated the place, and the sound system is awesome. Unfortunately we didn’t get much of a crowd, despite getting pretty good preshow press. I hung out with Lisa at the bar and talked to this woman who used to date a Fabio look-a-like. But he was too dumb, so she advised him to pursue a career in the military. Now she handles fish at an upscale grocery story.

I also met these two guys who came by to post flyers for their show. They heard a few songs during soundcheck and decided to hang out and catch my set, which was nice. They’re in a band called Telectro. <a href="http://www.imperfectmusic.com/">Check it out</a>.

Last night we played in Stevens Point at the Mission. We drove up early and did a little thing on 90.5fm with DJ Jeff, talking up the tour and the <a href="http://www.uvulittle.com">Uvulittle</a> label. Then I played a couple songs on the air, which is always fun.

Jordan and Silas at the Mission Coffeehouse are doing awesome things. I really love that place. Also on the bill was Shara Worden from a band called <a href="http://www.awrysense.com">Awry</a>. She lives in Brooklyn, in Park Slope, and I really liked her stuff, so I’m gonna see about playing some shows with her out eastish.

After I played I hung out with some of the local kids, Vlad the Russian and Kellen and Britney and Dominique. We played Gin Rummy and shot the shit. Goin on tour is a good way to break yourself of the fear of talking to strangers. If you have that problem. Which I do. Did!
