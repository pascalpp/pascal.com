Yesterday I piddled around for most of the day and then finally got off my duff to go running. I ran north to the Williamsburg Bridge, over to Manhattan, south to the Brooklyn Bridge, over to Brooklyn, then north to the Manhattan Bridge, back over to Manhattan, then back south to the Brooklyn Bridge again, and then over and home. Probly somewhere between 14 and 16 miles.

Then I went out with some friends from <a href="http://www.suicidegirls.com">SuicideGirls</a> for a long night of stupidity. Good stupidity. Ended up walking home from a diner in the rainy dawn light with two strange boys who crashed in my living room.

Today I’m in recovery.

<div class="commentbody">Howdy Pascal.  Just peeking in from VA, it’s nice to see you’re still kicking around up there and writing more often.  You may remember me as one of the guys that crashed on your floor last summer while we [All of Fifteen] were on tour.  I have funny photos of you leaping in the air next to a candelabra, I’ll have to email them.</div> -->
