Yesterday I piddled around for most of the day and then finally got off my duff to go running. I ran north to the Williamsburg Bridge, over to Manhattan, south to the Brooklyn Bridge, over to Brooklyn, then north to the Manhattan Bridge, back over to Manhattan, then back south to the Brooklyn Bridge again, and then over and home. Probly somewhere between 14 and 16 miles.

Then I went out with some friends from <a href="http://www.suicidegirls.com">SuicideGirls</a> for a long night of stupidity. Good stupidity. Ended up walking home from a diner in the rainy dawn light with two strange boys who crashed in my living room.

Today Iâ€™m in recovery.
