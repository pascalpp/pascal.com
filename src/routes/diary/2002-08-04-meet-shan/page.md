I made a new friend tonight. I can’t quite figure out if it’s a boy or a girl. His/her name is Shan. That’s usually a girl’s name, right? Well, I think she’s a girl. Ah, who knows. Anyway, Shan likes wine. Lots of it.

<div class="commentbody">You are such a total fucking crackhead. But funny. My question is, are you, like, totally rich or something? You never seem to work and yet you never seem to want for money. Did your dad own a diamond mine or something? Or were you president of some dot-com and you got out JUST BEFORE it all crashed and made 1857483948747384 BILLION dollars?</div>

<div class="commentbody">hey Pascal !!!  You put out a record !!  That’s great man !  I’ve always dug your tunes.  I can say I knew him when and all that.  Still livin’ in Paris, and we’re still rockin’.  Hamper is the name to watch - even though we suffer form lame-ass disorganized musicians with no management  syndrome.  If you end up doin’ a euopean tour, let me know and I’ll try to hook you up in Paris !  take care,  have a great tour   keep up the good work,  love  colin  p.s. your e-mail link don’t work so good</div>
