Yesterday I dressed up as Santa and roamed all over the streets of Manhattan with <a href="http://www.santacon.com/">hundreds of other Santas</a>. I think my favorite part was riding the subway.

Then last night we had the <a href="https://www.pascal.com/party/old/huggyparty/">Huggy Party</a>. There was lots of hugging and drinking and dancing and now I feel awful. I woke up at 6 in the morning and yorked it up into the toilet for a while. I canâ€™t remember the last time that happened. I thought I would feel better after that, but no such luck.

Now my landlord is coming over to discuss the noise complaint that our neighbors registered last night. Fun.
