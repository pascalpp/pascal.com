<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./01-rachel-raba.jpg" /></p>
Rachel and her doggie Raba.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./02-bobby-pascal.jpg" /></p>
Me and Bobby (from The Love of Everything) at the Mercury Lounge. I saw him play, then the Prosaics and then Joan of Arc. Check out that girl lookin all bad-ass behind us.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./03-kyle-caithlin.jpg" /></p>
Kyle and Caithlin. And Cookie.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./04-jason-helper.jpg" /></p>
Jason (from Mates of State) and the Hamburger Helper’s larger, scarier cousin.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./05-with-wesley.jpg" /></p>
A shot with Wesley Willis after the show. I think he’s lookin at some girl’s ass.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./06-kari-pete.jpg" /></p>
My friends Kari and Pete in a car goin to Brooklyn. After I took this picture, Kari’s eyes hopped out and strangled me to death.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./07-shannon.jpg" /></p>
Crazy Shannon rode in the front seat.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./08-anna-closet.jpg" /></p>
The next morning I woke up on a couch at Pete and Kari’s and built a closet with two total strangers. Actually they are Pete and Kari’s roommates. This is one of them, Anna. It’s her closet. Insert coming-out-of-the-closet joke here. Pat self on back for being so clever.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./09-kevin-eileen.jpg" /></p>
Kevin and Eileen hanging out at Dubway, the studio where Kyle recorded his new record. Kevin is laughing at your coming-out-of-the-closet joke. Mock-laughing, that is.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./10-mark-kyle-studio.jpg" /></p>
Mark Haines working the board at Dubway. You can sorta see Kyle through the glass.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./11-subway-sleepers.jpg" /></p>
Everyone seemed to be sleeping on the F train after we left the studio, so we did the same.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./12-b-rachel.jpg" /></p>
Here’s Rachel and B at work. They are getting ready to take a picture of Superman for an Adobe ad.

<p class="polaroid" style="--deg: -2deg"><img src="./13-b.jpg" /></p>
This is the last thing I saw before I left New York. No, that’s not a moustache.
