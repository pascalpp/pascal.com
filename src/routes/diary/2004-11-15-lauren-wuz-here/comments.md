<div class="commentbody">God is not dead…just read Blaise Pascal. He pondered the question, then wrote “The Wager”. I suspect he was much brighter than you, a current day “non-Pascal”. I pray that you will find the peace and happiness that Blaise Pascal discovered, once he was no longer an atheist. Also, C.S. Lewis was much smarter than you…but there is hope, if you will only seek enlightment. Don’t let anger control your very being. Let go and let God into your life.</div>

<div class="commentbody">Pascal’s Wager, summarized: “You should believe in God, because if there is a God, and you don’t believe in him, he will kick your ass.”

I don’t play the lottery, I don’t go to Vegas, and I don’t bet on God.</div> -->
