title: Troubleshooting an AppKit bug on Sonoma

summary: Trying to figure out why NSWorkspace.shared.desktopImageOptions no longer returns fillColor, the current desktop fill color. This used to work in macOS Monterey and Ventura, but no longer works in macOS Sonoma.

In the macOS AppKit framework, there's an API for setting the current desktop image, scaling method, and fill color. The method is [`NSWorkspace.shared.setDesktopImageURL`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsworkspace/1527228-setdesktopimageurl). This method accepts a file URL, a screen reference, and an options dicitionary, including `fillColor`.

Here's some sample code:

<details open>
  <summary><code>SetDesktopImageURL.swift</code></summary>

```swift
import Foundation
import AppKit

let workspace = NSWorkspace.shared
let screens = NSScreen.screens

let image = NSURL.fileURL(withPath: "/path/to/some/wallpaper.png")

// A nice blue green. This will show through any transparent areas of this image
let color = NSColor(calibratedRed: 64/255, green: 116/255, blue: 112/255, alpha: 1.0)

// NSImageScaling options https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsimagescaling
let fit = NSImageScaling.scaleProportionallyUpOrDown.rawValue

let options: [NSWorkspace.DesktopImageOptionKey: Any] = [
  .allowClipping: false,
  .imageScaling: fit,
  .fillColor: color,
]

for screen in screens {
  try workspace.setDesktopImageURL(image, for: screen, options: options)
}
```

</details>

We can verify the result using a related API method, [`NSWorkspace.shared.desktopImageOptions`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsworkspace/1530855-desktopimageoptions). This method returns a dictionary of the current desktop image options for the given screen.

More sample code:

<details open>
  <summary><code>DesktopImageOptions.swift</code></summary>

```swift
import AppKit
import Foundation

let screen = NSScreen.main!
let options = NSWorkspace.shared.desktopImageOptions(for: screen)!

print("imageScaling:", options[.imageScaling] as Any)
print("allowClipping:", options[.allowClipping] as Any)
print("fillColor:", options[.fillColor] as Any)
```

</details>

This code works as expected in macOS Monterey (version 12.x) and macOS Ventura (version 13.x):

#### Monterey

```
macOS version: 12.4.0
imageScaling: Optional(3)
allowClipping: Optional(0)
fillColor: Optional(NSCalibratedRGBColorSpace ...) <-- good
```

#### Ventura

```
macOS version: 13.6.0
imageScaling: Optional(3)
allowClipping: Optional(0)
fillColor: Optional(NSCalibratedRGBColorSpace ...) <-- good
```

But in Sonoma (version 14.x), the `fillColor` key is missing from the returned dictionary:

#### Sonoma

```
macOS version: 14.4.1
imageScaling: Optional(3)
allowClipping: Optional(0)
fillColor: nil <-- bad
```

Similarly, when calling `setDesktopImageURL`, Sonoma seems to ignore the `fillColor` option, and always sets the fill color to some default blue (even if I have previously set it to some other color manually.)

### Next steps

So at this point I'm pretty sure this is a regression in macOS Sonoma. If you have any experience with this API and know of a workaround, [I'd love to hear it!](mailto:pascal+fillcolor@pascal.com) If you'd like to try out the above on your Mac and report your results to me, I've created a [minimal sample project](https://github.com/pascalpp/current-desktop-color) on Github. I'm working up the nerve to file a bug report with Apple, but I haven't done that before and from what I've heard I'm not particularly hopeful that it will get me anywhere. But I'll try anyway.

### A cool thing I found along the wayâ€¦

I discovered this amazing macOS virtualization tool, [Tart](https://tart.run/quick-start/).

![macOS Ventura running in Tart](./tart-ventura.webp)

It allows you to run different versions of macOS (and Linux) in virtual containers on your Mac. I used it to test the above code on Ventura, as I didn't have a machine with that version running. [The setup is dead-easy](https://tart.run/quick-start/) (if you already have `homebrew` installed). It does take a while to download an OS image, but once that's done the container starts up incredibly quickly, and feels just as responsive as my actual Mac. Definitely worth a look if you do any macOS development.
