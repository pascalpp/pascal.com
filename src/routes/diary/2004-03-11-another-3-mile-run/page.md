Meh.

Tonight we went to see an all-girl Depeche Mode cover band. We got there right when the band finished and Lauren and her friend couldn't get in anyway. Then we walked a few blocks down Houston Street to get gelato at this place that Caithlin recommended. But we got there and it was closed. After some deliberation we decided to just go home. Then we walked to the subway but the entrance was closed. So we walked to another one. It was open.

Amazing, I know.
