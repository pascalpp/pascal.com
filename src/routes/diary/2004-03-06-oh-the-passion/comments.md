<div class="commentbody">sorry you wasted your time - stick to disney.

seems ironic that nobody is bothered by the gratuitous viloence of a terminator flick but add Jesus and voila - scandal! why is everyone so afraid of the Bible and the good it ultimately represents - take faith, Christianity and any other symblance of secular religion out of the mix and the end message is still “do unto others”. relax.</div>
