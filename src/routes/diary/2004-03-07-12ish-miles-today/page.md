Today I ran over the Manhattan Bridge to Manhattan then south to the Brooklyn Bridge and back over to Brooklyn. Then I did it again. And then I did it again!

I AM THE SERENEST!

Actually, I think I was high. Except I don’t remember smoking anything.

Here’s the ped path on the Manhattan Bridge. Cellphones take ugly pictures.

The bridge looks prettier on the Manhattan end. Cellphones take ugly pictures.

I saw this three times today. Sorry, I’m still high. And cellphones still take ugly pictures.

Today I got my first nipple bleed. Bitchen. Gonna have to tape them suckers down next time.
