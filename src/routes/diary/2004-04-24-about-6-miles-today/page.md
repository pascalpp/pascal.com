I did a lap over the Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges and then ran to the gym and did another mile on the treadmill. Makin my way back to you, babe.

Today is so beautiful. Days like today make me wish I had a girlfriend. Where the fuck are you? I been lookin, I swear.

Tonight I’m goin to see <a href="http://www.rosepolenzani.com">Rose Polenzani</a> at the Living Room. Been listening to her record over and over again so’s I can sing along. It’s addictive.

Oh a few days ago I shaved off all my hair in a fit. Spring cleaning or something. Soon I’ll look like a newborn bird. Here’s a pic.

Okay I have to go back out in the sunshine.
