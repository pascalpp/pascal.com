Today I ran about 3 miles around Humboldt Park here in Chicago. It was the first run I’ve done in about 2 weeks, since my leg has been hurting so much. I could still feel the pain in my shin today, but it felt pretty good overall, and it got better toward the end of the run. When I got back I stretched for a while and put some hippie ben-gay on it and now I’m feeling fine and smelling like lavender.
