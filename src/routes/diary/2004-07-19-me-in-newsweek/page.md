If you have a copy of this week’s Newsweek, you’ll find a picture of me on page 42, top left, as part of a spread on the iPod craze. Not a very good shot of my face, but you can clearly see my green sneaks. The photo was taken by my friend <a href="http://www.jeromepix.com">Jerome</a> at the Smith-9th Street subway station here in Brooklyn.
