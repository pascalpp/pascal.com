Okay, here we go.

It’s widely known that there have been some peculiar voting problems in some states. In particular, there was an incident in a suburb of Columbus, Ohio, where Bush received nearly 4000 votes, in a precinct with only 800 total voters (cf. The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/06/politics/campaign/06ohio.html">Nov 6</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/politics/campaign/07elect.html">Nov 7</a>). It remains to be seen whether this was merely an isolated incident, or perhaps a symptom of a more widespread systemic problem.

I’m not crying foul, at least not yet. But there is mounting evidence that many things may not be right with the mechanics of this election. I’ve been culling various sources for information on this possibility, but I’ve also been withholding judgment and suppressing the conspiracy theorist in me as much as possible.

Still, there are some really questionable things about how it all played out, particularly in the all important states of Florida and Ohio.

For starters, read this article:

Also, here is a lengthy compendium of voting irregularities nationwide.

To be clear, I’m not declaring the election null and void, nor am I declaring that something nefarious is afoot. But I think there are enough anomalies in this election to warrant some basic questioning and verification. As citizens we deserve a fully audited and verified vote count in every election. The rush to replace antiquated voting systems with electronic alternatives has put us in the position of using machines that have not been properly tested and secured, and it has left us without a path of recourse should a recount be needed. This must be rectified.

I’ll be writing more on this in the coming days.

<div class="commentbody">At this point, I am convinced that the election was stolen.

Here are just a few examples that were known on Nov 5 and included in a letter to the GAO by 3 members of Congress:

In Columbus, Ohio, an electronic voting system gave President Bush nearly 4,000 extra votes. “Machine Error Gives Bush Extra Ohio Votes,” Associated Press, November 5.

An electronic tally of a South Florida gambling ballot initiative failed to record thousands of votes. “South Florida OKs Slot Machines Proposal,” Id.

In one North Carolina county, more than 4,500 votes were lost because officials mistakenly believed a computer that stored ballots could hold more data that it did. “Machine Error Gives Bush Extra Ohio Votes,” Id.

In San Francisco, a glitch occurred with voting machines software that resulted in some votes being left uncounted. Id.

In Florida, there was a substantial drop off in Democratic votes in proportion to voter registration in counties utilizing optical scan machines that was apparently not present in counties using other mechanisms. <a href="http://ustogether.org/election04/florida_vote_patt.htm">http://ustogether.org/election04/florida_vote_patt.htm</a>

The House Judiciary Committee Democratic staff has received numerous reports from Youngstown, Ohio that voters who attempted to cast a vote for John Kerry on electronic voting machines saw that their votes were instead recorded as votes for George W. Bush. In South Florida, Congressman Wexler�s staff received numerous reports from voters in Palm Beach, Broward and Dade Counties that they attempted to select John Kerry but George Bush appeared on the screen. CNN has reported that a dozen voters in six states, particularly Democrats in Florida, reported similar problems. This was among over one thousand such problems reported. “Touchscreen Voting Problems Reported,” Associated Press, November 5.

Excessively long lines were a frequent problem throughout the nation in Democratic precincts, particularly in Florida and Ohio. In one Ohio voting precinct serving students from Kenyon College, some voters were required to wait more than eight hours to vote. “All Eyes on Ohio,” Dan Lothian, CNN, November 3, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/blog/1...blog/index.htm..">http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/blog/1…blog/index.htm..</a>

<div class="commentbody">it was a rip that bush won. he only won because all the rich ass people want to get more money while the people who are not financially stable get worse. i feel that we should have a new election, mostly after we kick bush out of the compotion!!! yup i think a women should be president.   i herd that clintons wife was running but she didnt make it to the stage for her to run. i also think a black man or women should be president because we need change in America, its only becoming a war zone!!!   but this is not my matter!!! cause i CANT VOTE!! </div> -->
