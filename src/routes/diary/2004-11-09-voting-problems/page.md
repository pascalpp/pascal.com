Okay, here we go.

It’s widely known that there have been some peculiar voting problems in some states. In particular, there was an incident in a suburb of Columbus, Ohio, where Bush received nearly 4000 votes, in a precinct with only 800 total voters (cf. The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/06/politics/campaign/06ohio.html">Nov 6</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/07/politics/campaign/07elect.html">Nov 7</a>). It remains to be seen whether this was merely an isolated incident, or perhaps a symptom of a more widespread systemic problem.

I’m not crying foul, at least not yet. But there is mounting evidence that many things may not be right with the mechanics of this election. I’ve been culling various sources for information on this possibility, but I’ve also been withholding judgment and suppressing the conspiracy theorist in me as much as possible.

Still, there are some really questionable things about how it all played out, particularly in the all important states of Florida and Ohio.

For starters, read this article:

Also, here is a lengthy compendium of voting irregularities nationwide.

To be clear, I’m not declaring the election null and void, nor am I declaring that something nefarious is afoot. But I think there are enough anomalies in this election to warrant some basic questioning and verification. As citizens we deserve a fully audited and verified vote count in every election. The rush to replace antiquated voting systems with electronic alternatives has put us in the position of using machines that have not been properly tested and secured, and it has left us without a path of recourse should a recount be needed. This must be rectified.

I’ll be writing more on this in the coming days.
