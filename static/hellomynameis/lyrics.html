<p><b>and boom a shock</b><br>
and boom a shock, a rock was thrown, and had i known i might have ducked but no, it hit my throat - it made me clutch and choke and then another rock hit my crotch - i doubled over and broke and for all the spitting i tried to speak and the words i spoke was - wait a minute, there must be more than this, this doesn't hurt so much - and in the middle of me you will Þnd a tender thing i can feel ya tuggin on my heart strings and in the middle of me you can hear a birdie sing - let me out of the ribcage</p>

<p><b>body on my bones</b><br>
and i'm tired of my body hangin offa my bones, and i'm tired of your number bein on my telephone, and i'm tired of the letters that never seem to come, and i'm tired of talkin and always soundin so dumb - so i wait, hopin that i might hear your name, hopin that you'll feel the same, and knowin that your comin back makes it that much easier to stay - and i'm tired of my feet always stickin out of the covers, and i'm tired of everybody i meet lookin like some ex-lover, and i'm tired of the water drippin down when it rains, and i'm tired of all the leaky thinkin faucets in my brain - so i wait, hopin that i might hear your name, hopin that you'll feel the same, and knowin that your comin back makes it that much easier to stay - and it wasn't so hard to realize that i was hallucinatin everything before my eyes, and it wasn't so easy waking up from the dream, and it wasn't so easy drinkin buttermilk instead of cream - and i'm tired of my body hangin offa my bones</p>

<p><b>you'll pick my name</b><br>
i open my windows to the rain again and again - i feel you waiting for me behind the sky and i want to þy - and i feel you waiting  behind the sky, i feel you waiting for me - i open my door to the sun and you are the one that i hope to Þnd there - feeling your Þngers and everything lingers around me when you are around me, and you are around - and i feel you waiting behind the sky, i feel you waiting for me - will you keep on waiting, i'm running to catch up, will you keep on waiting for me - well i'll pick you þowers and you'll pick my name when i'm born, and i'm torn between you and me</p>

<p><b>mayor</b><br>
walkin down a country road down by your old house, pardon my rhyme - happened upon a toad havin a footrace with a mouse, pardon my metaphor - and i saw you sitting up there, in your easy chair, and i thought to myself, you should take it easy - and where have the neighbors gone, they've all disappeared, but where have they up and gone, they've all moved to the city, leaving you here in your easy chair - you should take it easy, you should take it easy, you did all of this yourself - and the water fell down and it covered the ground around your house, but you didn't get wet at all, no you didn't get wet at all - you should take it easy, you did all of this yourself, you wanted to mayor, now there is no town to may over - you should take it easy - yeah</p>

<p><b>crazy</b><br>
i was walkin to your house, i was thinkin i'd like to see ya, i was hoping that you would be there, i was crazy for thinkin such a thing - you ain't give nothin no more to me - so i kept on walkin to your neighbor's house, thought that they might know your whereabouts, but they didn't know of your whereabouts, i was crazy for walkin to your neighbor's house - so i called up information, thought they might know where you was hangin out, but they didn't have no information, i was crazy for callin information</p>

<p><b>a story about a car</b><br>
i wanna tell you a story, a story about a car - it went very fast, but it didn't get very far - i don't wanna take you home, i would rather break your bones, why don't you just leave me alone, you're the worst thing i've ever known - Þll me up with gasoline, gotta keep my motor clean, fastest thing you ever seen deep in the night - won't you take me home</p>

<p><b>roughin me over</b><br>
i was waiting for you to come home, didn't wanna be left here alone, didn't you think it would be enough to rough me up and down and rough me over - aw yer just roughenin' me up for another roll in the clover - yer roughin me over - i didn't think it would happen quite this way, thought we might go on a little holiday, but the night came on and you had to say that you are the lumberjack and i am the lumber - aw you keep cuttin me down without botherin to yell timber - timber! - yer roughin me over, yer roughin me up - i went down to your mother's house to see what the hell your next step was gonna be, girl you really got the best of me, now you're gonna get the worst - oh!</p>

<p><b>no can't do anything</b><br>
and if you are sitting there saying, no, no, no you won't be getting there saying, no, no, no cuz no can't do anything and i know everything i know, i know, i know - and in the nighttime i sleep all alone i think of the bones that hold up your body - i think of the word archaeology, or maybe i mean anthropology - i'm sorry for meeting your body, a body i must leave alone and the only thing i've ever known - and i know everything and no can't do anything, i know, i know, i know - and if you are sitting there praying for something to happen, you won't be sitting there praying for long - cuz i don't know what to say, but i kneel down anyway and pray for everything i know - and in the daytime i walk all alone, i walk past the home that once held your body i think of your body's geography, or maybe i mean your geometry i'm sorry for meeting your body a body i must leave alone and the only thing i've ever known - did i teach you anything, cuz you taught me so many things i know, almost everything i know</p>

<p><b>bride of frankenstein</b><br>
and the lines were drawn and the blinds were down in the holy hoke of this old town, and the lightning will strike the ground just as soon as you step aside - cuz you're the bride of frankenstein this time, you're the ride that's got the whole damn town standing in line - and the lines were down and the blind were drawn, there would be no light til the break of dawn, and mr. jenkins mowed his lawn as the clock struck midnight - and you're the bride of frankenstein this time, you're the ride that's got the whole damn town standing in line - standing in line, wasting their time, with their torches held high, wondering why there's a blackening sky, and they're wasting their time just standing in line</p>

<p><b>mud</b><br>
you might be with me feeling lonely, and i might be with you feeling lonely too - and my name, my name is mud and i'm doin everything i think i should - my name is mud, and your name is lonely, and i might be with you feeling lonely too, and my head is a candle burning, soon it will be down to nothing, and my head is a building crumbling, soon it will be down - and my name, my name is mud and i'm doin everything i think i should - my name is mud, and your name is lonely, and i might be with you feeling lonely too, and my head is a civilization, soon it will be just a ruin, and my head is a solar system slowly winding down - and my name, my name is mud and i'm doin everything i think i should, and i am beneath you and all the things you do, and every step that you take, it makes an impression on me, my name is mud - my name is mud, and your name is</p>

<p><b>you to dance</b><br>
and the day would not wait for me, and i could not catch up with it, and as the night descended on me, in the morning i hoped i would forget - and i shoulda tried when i only had the chance, but i start to cry as i ask you to dance - and i have known you since high school, and you have known me too, and you have known me to do some crazy things, and i have known you to do them too - and i shoulda tried when i only had the chance, but i start to cry as i ask you to dance - and i hate to use the word regret, but i don't know what else to call it, cuz there ain't no other word for it - and the day would not wait for me, and i could not catch up with it, and as the night descended on me, in the morning i hoped i would forget - and i shoulda tried when i only had the chance, but i start to cry as i ask you to dance, you to dance</p>

<p><b>halfway dead</b><br>
i was breakin pencils and chewin on the eraser, thinkin about tearin up paper - i was tryin to write you a letter, but i kept havin to start over, and i kept tearin up the pieces of paper, and pretty soon the garbage can was full - ah, the rain inside my head, ow - breakin pencils, chewin on the eraser, thinkin about tearin up paper - and the trees around my head are fallin down and i don't care, i'm halfway here, and halfway there, and halfway dead</p>
