<B CLASS="header">Some Movies I Made</B>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=480 ALIGN=LEFT>

Here are some movies I've made over the years. You will need to have <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/" TARGET="_top">QuickTime</A> installed in order to view these movies. Click on a movie link to view it in a separate browser window. These movies are a bit large, so be prepared to wait a bit before viewing if you are on a dialup connection.<BR>&#160;<BR>

These movies were all made using a Canon Mini-DV camera and edited on a Macintosh using iMovie or Final Cut Pro. Make your own movies! It's easy! Get a Mac.<BR>&#160;<BR>

<B>Sucky Hollow</B><BR>
This movie is a parody of Tim Burton's awful (IMO) movie Sleepy Hollow. This was made with a few friends of mine in Birmingham, AL. It's only slightly worse than the movie that inspired it.<BR>
