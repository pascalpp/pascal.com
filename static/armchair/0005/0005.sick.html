That's right, folks, you can't be stickin yo dick in no cake and expect some fool to eat it. But folks be stupid, folks be watchin TV.<P>You want democracy, you give every one an equal say in what goes down. You think that's what we got, you better pass me that bowl, mofo.<P>Imagine you be a politician. You raise the price on gasoline, you raise a big ruckus, too. You raise the gas tax, people be banging on your door, kidnapping your children and shit. These people are not fanatics, they're not extremists or radicals.
