You get in a car, you can pretty much prepare yourself for some unhappiness. I haven't driven in a long time, but I remember the feeling of frustration each time a light turned red, the reluctance to use the brakes unless absolutely necessary. I hated the stress of rush hour traffic. I wondered why the hell so many other people had to be driving at the same time.<P>And yet, have you ever seen a car commercial which portrays the hell of 5 o'clock gridlock? No sir, it's all open road and mountain passes, if you buy this car.<P>I remember hating pedestrians, what the hell are they doing, trying to cross the street? Can't they see I'm in a car and I can go faster than them and I am therefore more important than them?<P>The sickest part of all is the loss of human scale in our daily lives. There is no longer a definition of space that is centered on the human, there is only the definition of space that is centered on the human who happens to be encased in a car. Oh, there is simply too much to cover here. I'll talk about zoning and urban planning some other time.<P>For now, perhaps you'd like to look over the fine selection of automobiles available from <A HREF="http://www.bmwusa.com/">BMW</A> or <A HREF="http://www.hondacars.com/">Honda</A> or <A HREF="http://www.toyota.com/">Toyota</A> or <A HREF="http://www.plymouthcars.com/">Plymouth</A> or <A HREF="http://www.saturncars.com/">Saturn</A> or <A HREF="http://www.landrover.com/">Land Rover</A> or <A HREF="http://www.chrysler.com/">Chrysler</A> or even <A HREF="http://www.gm.com/">General Motors</A>?<P>Maybe you'd even like to hear about the first mass production <A HREF="http://www.gmev.com/">electric car</A>?<P>I can't believe I'm doing this. Hopefully you're not taking me seriously. Maybe instead you'd like to scrap that hunkojunk and buy a bike?
