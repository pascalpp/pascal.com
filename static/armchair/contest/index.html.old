welcome to my <font size=5><b>contest!</b></font>
<img src="../constants/pointer.gif"><br>
<br>
okay this is a real simple contest.<br>
<br>
all you have to do is figure out where i live. you will find clues throughout my armchair. read, try to figure it out. or fuck off. i don't care if you don't want to play my contest. loser.<br>
<br>
to win, you have to <a href="mailto:contest@pascal.com">tell me</a> the name of the city and the state. very simple.<br>
<br>
oh, that was your first clue.<br>
<br>
it is almost certainly a city you have heard of, but i will never tell you explicitly. i don't think.<br>
<br>
there are some rules. <b>rule one: you cannot be anyone i know. rule two: you cannot live in this same city.</b> i don't know why that's a rule, but it just is. at least for now. <b>rule three: i reserve the right to change the rules.</b><br>
<br>
the winner will receive the food item of their choice, up to a value of, say, $3.00, without going over. okay, i'm no bob barker, you can go over-budget a little. said food item will be shipped, free of charge, anywhere on this planet. pretty tempting, huh?<br>
<br>
okay, so where do i live? you tell me. coolest (wrong) answers will recieve the dubious honor of being cut and pasted here for all the world to see. oh yeah: <b>rule four: if you send me email, any information in your message becomes my property, to do with as i wish.</b> like you were worried.
