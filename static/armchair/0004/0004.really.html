The word product has always made me wince; this time was no different.<P>well, what do you expect a company to do? i certainly don't blame them for trying to sell more product. i'm simply saying that i find it pretty sketchy when people start pretending that a community can be built around such goals. community is about people meeting people, sharing ideas and stories, developing love. i'd like to do a global search for the word 'love' on all the corporate websites i've done. okay i will. hold on.<P><UL><UL><FONT SIZE=4><B>&#160;&#160;[&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;]</B></FONT></UL></UL><P>okay, the search is running on another machine. anyway, there have been some encouraging signs that perhaps there is some sort of community out there, a possibility of developing real relationships, even through an electronic medium. these signs are largely in the form of nice people like yourself who happen to visit my site and take the time to drop me a note, and occasionally a respectable conversation follows. that's encouraging. but email is certainly no substitute for face-to-face interaction. a wonderful complement to it, to be sure, but it leaves much to be desired on its own. i remain convinced that no technological advances will improve this much, be it live audio or videoconferencing, what have you. anything short of a teleporter, count me on the side of the skeptics.<P>okay the results are in. there were 54 matches to the word 'love'. none of these were used in the context of interpersonal love. most of them were referring to 'love' of objects such as horses or countries and such. my personal favorite comes from the kemper site:<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>&gt;&#160;&#160;Mobility is a characteristic<BR>&gt;&#160;&#160;of American life. We love<BR>&gt;&#160;&#160;our cars.</B></FONT><P>i really should be working. i think i may just cut and paste this email into the armchair and call it an update. cheating, huh? ah, who cares. job security? what's <A HREF="../menu.html">that</A>?<!-- #include ":armchair:content-right-end.incl"	 #ISSUE#="0004"	 #DATE#="Wednesday, July 10, 1996" -->	</TT>	</TD>	<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=10 NOWRAP>&#160;</TD>	</TR>		<TR>	<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=BOTTOM HEIGHT=25 NOWRAP COLSPAN=3>	<IMG SRC="../constants/pointer-long.gif">	</TD>	</TR>		<TR>	<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=10 NOWRAP>&#160;</TD>	<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=2>	<FONT SIZE=2>	<TT>	<A HREF="../menu.html">armchair</A> #0004 - Wednesday, July 10, 1996	</TT>	</FONT>	</TD>	</TR>	</TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><!-- end include --></BODY></HTML>
