			<P><B>My Story:</B><BR>
			Although I've been using a Macintosh for years, I've never programmed any Macintosh applications. I've played around with AppleScript, as well as a fair amount of JavaScript and a wee bit of Perl in my job as a web designer. But I wanted to build REAL applications. I bought a book called Programming Starter Kit for Macintosh, but even that was over my head. I resigned myself to being a user. Eck.<BR>
			<BR>
			Then I started playing around with a program called REALbasic a few days ago. Last night at about 8pm I started building this little application as an experiment. Here it is not 24 hours later and the damn thing is done!<BR>
			<BR>
			REALbasic is an amazing tool from RealSoftware. If you've ever wanted to build Macintosh applications but found the task too daunting, you owe it to yourself to check out REALbasic!<BR>
